Unless someone can find a citation that Jacqueline Kennedy was inspired by the eternal flame at the arc de triomphe, we should consider this coincidence and it should be removed.

Is it right to say ''the'' tomb of the Unknown soldier, shouldn''t that be the the 
French tomb of the Unknown soldier or the tomb of the Unknown soldier in France? -Adrian.

----
I''m severely tempted to say I don''t know.

I like the idea of being more specific about which Tomb of the Unknown.  I believe in the United States the Tomb is in Arlington National Cemetary, but I don''t know if the tomb is of a soldier killed in the first world war, the second, or the civil war, or what.  I guess one soldier is enough, its the idea that counts.

Regardless, being specific that it''s the French Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, is a good revision, do it.

''''''Affirming the consequent'''''', sometimes called ''''''converse error'''''' or ''''''fallacy of the converse'''''', is a [[formal fallacy]] of inferring the [[converse (logic)|converse]] from the original statement. The corresponding argument has the general [[argument form|form]]:

#If ''''P'''', then ''''Q''''.
#''''Q''''.
#Therefore, ''''P''''.

An argument of this form is [[validity|invalid]], i.e., the conclusion can be false even when statements 1 and 2 are true.  Since ''''P'''' was never asserted as the ''''only'''' sufficient condition for ''''Q'''', other factors could account for ''''Q'''' (while ''''P'''' was false).

To put it differently, if ''''P'''' implies ''''Q'''', the ''''''only'''''' inference that can be made is ''''non-Q'''' implies ''''non-P''''.  (''''Non-P'''' and ''''non-Q'''' designate the opposite propositions to ''''P'''' and ''''Q''''.)  Symbolically:

==Significant overhaul underway==
I have made some big changes to the structure of the article, and will continue to work on text. This is a good start, but many things need to be elaborated and clarified. This entry needs serious help! I am an archaeologist with training in North America, so the emphasis may have shifted somewhat. I''m hoping others will fill in information on the discipline in other world areas. I''m also unsure how to go about making significant changes without erasing previous text. I hope no one is offended - I''m just interested in getting this entry right. --[[User:Mybvega|Mybvega]] 23:29, 20 October 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for starting this overhaul, this page really needed it. The changes are an improvement, but more work is needed.--[[User:Nathancraig|NathanCraig]] 00:43, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

''''''Amateur astronomy'''''', also called ''''''backyard astronomy'''''' and ''''''stargazing'''''', is a [[hobby]] whose participants enjoy watching the [[sky]], and the abundance of objects found in it, mainly with portable [[telescopes]] and [[binoculars]]. Even though [[scientific research]] is not their main goal, many amateur astronomers make a contribution to astronomy by monitoring variable stars, tracking asteroids and discovering transient objects, such as comets.

The typical amateur astronomer is one who does not depend on the field of astronomy as a primary source of [[income]] or support, and does not have a [[professional degree]] or advanced academic training in the subject.  Many amateurs are beginners or [[hobby]]ists, while others have a high degree of experience in astronomy and often assist and work alongside professional astronomers.

Amateur astronomy is usually associated with viewing the [[night sky]] when most celestial objects and events are visible, but sometimes amateur astronomers also operate during the day for events such as [[sunspot]]s and [[solar eclipse]]s.  Amateur astronomers often look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes, but common tools for amateur astronomy include portable [[optical telescope|telescopes]] and [[binoculars]].

People have studied the sky throughout history in an amateur framework, without any formal method of funding.  It is only within about the past century, however, that amateur astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from professional astronomy, and other related activi')

In the criminal procedure of some common law jurisdictions, an ''''''allocution'''''' or ''''''allocutus'''''' is a formal statement to the court by the defendant who has been found guilty before sentencing.

A allocution in mitigation allows the defendant to explain why the sentence should be lenient.

In [[plea bargain]]s, an allocution may be required of the defendant; the defendant explicitly admits specifically and in detail to what he or she did and for what reason, in exchange for a reduced sentence.  In principle, it removes any doubt as to the exact nature of the defendant''s guilt in the matter.

== Creation of the Cyrillic alphabet ==

The theory that the Cyrillic aphabet was created by St. Clement of Ohrid is old and not the most popular. Today, it is considered that the alphabet was invented in Preslav, not in Ohrid. See the article about [[Cyrillic alphabet]] for more information.[[User:Scheludko|Scheludko]] ([[User talk:Scheludko|talk]]) 18:47, 28 February 2010 (UTC)

== Lede image ==
Is there any particular reason the lede image illustrates only one alphabet, the Latin one? Given that this is a general article, maybe it would be nice to use an image (which someone could create from Inkscape or something) showing several widely-used alphabets: Latin and Cyrillic, and perhaps abudigas like Arabic and Devangari; if there''s space, we could also include slightly lesser-used alphabets and abudigas such as Hangul, Greek, and Thai (i.e., those that are used only for one major language).')

''''''Astatine'''''' is a [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[chemical element]] with the [[chemical symbol]] ''''''At'''''' and atomic number 85. It occurs on Earth only as the result of the radioactive decay of certain heavier elements. All of its [[isotope]]s are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a [[half-life]] of 8.1 hours. Accordingly, much less is known about astatine than most other elements. The observed properties are consistent with it being a heavier analog of [[iodine]]; many other properties have been estimated based on this resemblance.

Elemental astatine has never been viewed, because a mass large enough to be seen (by the naked human eye) would be immediately vaporized by the heat generated by its own radioactivity. Astatine may be dark, or it may have a metallic appearance and be a semiconductor, or it may even be a metal. It is likely to have a much higher melting point than does iodine, on par with those of [[bismuth]] and polonium. Chemically, astatine behaves more or less as a [[halogen]], being expected to form ionic astatides with [[alkali metal|alkali]] or [[alkaline earth metal|alkaline earth]] metals; it is known to form covalent compounds with nonmetals, including [[interhalogen|other halogens]]. It does, however, also have a notable cationic chemistry that distinguishes it from the lighter halogens. The second longest-lived isotope of astatine, astatine-211, is the only one currently having any commercial application, being employed in medicine to diagnose and treat some diseases via its emission of [[alpha particles]] (helium-4 nuclei). Only extremely small quantities are used, however, due to its intense radioactivity.

The element was first produced by [[Dale R. Corson]], [[Kenneth Ross MacKenzie]], and [[Emilio Segr')

Likewise, a group of atoms can remain bound to each other by [[chemical bond]]s based on the same force, forming a [[molecule]]. An atom containing an equal number of protons and electrons is electrically neutral, otherwise it is positively or negatively charged and is known as an [[ion]]. An atom is [[Periodic table|classified]] according to the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus: the [[atomic number|number of protons]] determines the [[chemical element]], and the [[neutron number|number of neutrons]] determines the [[isotope]] of the element.')

Errrrrr nooooooo! I read Automated Alice and just finished it yesterday, what I''ve wrote so far are ''''my'''' ([[User:Neeklamy|Neeklamy]]''s) own words, I didn''t lift them from anywhere!

I find it a bit disconcerting to be accused of [[:plagiarism|plagiarism]] - was it not obvious that this text is just a summary? That I wrote it (in good heart) in the style of the book? The book itself came out in 1996 and has been published a number of times over since - it''s out there for anyone to track down ISBN: 0552999059 and read and it runs to a bit more than a few mere paragraphs of poorly revised text (more like 252 pages of some very witty dialogue).

I''m sure you didn''t mean offence, what with a number of indivduals stealing wholesale from various resources, but seriously, idle accusations of copyright infringement aren''t appreciated at all - personally I would never plagiarise and would never do anything to harm this new forum.

{{Neuron map|Axon}}
An ''''''axon'''''' (from Greek, axis) also known as a nerve fibre; is a long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or [[neuron]], that typically conducts [[action potential|electrical impulses]] away from the neuron''s [[cell body]]. The function of the axon is to transmit information to different neurons, muscles and glands. In certain sensory neurons ([[pseudounipolar neuron]]s), such as those for touch and warmth, the electrical impulse travels along an axon from the periphery to the cell body, and from the cell body to the spinal cord along another branch of the same axon. Axon dysfunction causes many inherited and acquired neurological disorders which can affect both the peripheral and central neurons.

An axon is one of two types of [[protoplasm]]ic protrusions that extrude from the cell body of a neuron, the other type being [[dendrite]]s.  Axons are distinguished from dendrites by several features, including shape (dendrites often taper while axons usually maintain a constant radius), length (dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer), and function (dendrites usually receive signals while axons usually transmit them).  All of these rules have exceptions, however.

Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites.  No neuron ever has more than one axon; however in invertebrates such as insects or leeches the axon sometimes consists of several regions that function more or less independently of each other.')

I don''t have that book, and I can''t find the quoted text on the net, so I can''t verify whether or not this text was copied from that book.  I ''''can'''' verify that if it was, it is clearly a copyright violation not covered by fair use.  Small excerpts can be used in a larger work for commentary, criticism, parody, and the like; copies may also be made for classroom use.  But this doesn''t qualify as any of those: the paragraph isn''t being taken so that we can comment on itin a larger work--it''s being taken merely to reproduce it as is, for exactly the same use as the original copyrighted work, which is clearly infringement. --[[User:Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]
----
With apologies to the author if, e.g., the author was simply citing ANCIENT SCRIPTS as a bibliographic source, but without further information from the person who put this information up, it just looks to me like it was swiped from the book.  So I''m taking it down--though I will be very happy to put it back immediately if the author can assure me it wasn''t copied out of a book. --[[User:LMS|LMS]]

naw, that was only quoting, well, paraphrasing actually. certainly not a violation of intellectual property. Well, I 
rre-introduced some of the old info; i hope, it won''t disappear again... anyway, no quotes in it, so everybody should be happy, and no info that needs a bibliography. [[User:Wathiik|Wathiik]]

well, i think now it''s obvious that it isn''t plagiarism (reminds me of my first year of studying english when everybody warned about plagiarism... [[User:Wathiik|Wathiik]]

----
Please don''t confuse copyright violation with plagiarism--they are different things entirely.  Plagiarism is misrepresenting someone else''s work as your own; if one simply copies a paragraph from a book making no mention of the source and present it as if you had written it yourself, that''s plagiarism.  If you copy a paragraph from a book, ''''giving full credit'''' to the correct author, that''s not plagiarism, but it is probably still a copyright violation.  If you rewrite the information from a text in your own words, that''s called research :-) --LDC

I''m assuming the content of [[:agma|agma]] is no longer a copyright violation.  Another happy ending!  --[[User:LMS|LMS]]
----
Well, it never WAS  a copyright violation, even though it probably did LOOK like a violation. Anway, it''s true, a happy ending...  anyway, plagiarism is probably a form of copyright violation in its own right. You can sue someone for plagiarism, and you can sue someone for other kinds of copyright violations; although no one would sue a student, I guess... as long as s/he doesn''t publish it on the internet ...

An ''''''abscess'''''' ({{Lang-lat|abscessus}}) is a collection of [[pus]] ([[neutrophils]]) that has accumulated within a tissue because of an inflammatory process in response to either an [[infection|infectious]] process (usually caused by [[bacteria]] or [[parasite]]s) or other foreign materials (e.g., splinters, [[bullet]] [[wound]]s, or injecting needles). It is a [[immune system|defensive reaction]] of the tissue to prevent the spread of infectious materials to other parts of the body. 

The organisms or foreign materials kill the local [[cell (biology)|cells]], resulting in the release of [[cytokine]]s.  The cytokines trigger an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]], which draws large numbers of [[white blood cell]]s to the area and increases the regional [[blood]] flow.

The final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall, or capsule, that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep the pus from infecting neighboring structures. However, such encapsulation tends to prevent immune cells from attacking bacteria in the pus, or from reaching the causative organism or foreign object.

Abscesses must be differentiated from [[empyema]]s, which are accumulations of pus in a preexisting rather than a newly formed anatomical cavity.

Most all the tests I''ve seen of these algorithms add some unrealistic constant (i.e. 10^6 or larger) to the dataset to demonstrate that the suggested algorithm on this page is indeed better. I naively used this algorithm in my own work, to horrible effect. My dataset consists of a large number of discrete values, perhaps with the values -1, 0, or 1, and with an average usually between -1 and 1. I wrote the following simple test program to demonstrate the difference in results between what I''ll call METHOD1 (using a running sum and sum of squares of the dataset) and METHOD2 (using a running computation of the average and the variance, which the current wiki strongly recommends).')

A [[List of Prime Ministers of Antigua and Barbuda|Prime Minister]] is appointed by the Governor-General as the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]; the Prime Minister advises the Governor-General on the appointment of a Council of Ministers. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government.  [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the two chambers of the [[Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda|Parliament]]. The [[bicameral]] Parliament consists of the Senate (seventeen-member body appointed by the Governor General) and the House of Representatives (seventeen seats; members are elected by proportional representation to serve five-year terms).

Antigua and Barbuda has a long history of free elections, three of which have resulted in peaceful changes of government. Since the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 1951|1951 general election]], the party system has been dominated by the personalist [[Antigua Labour Party]] (ALP), dominated by the Bird family, particularly Prime Ministers [[Vere Bird|Vere]] and [[Lester Bird]]. The opposition claimed to be disadvantaged by the ALP''s longstanding monopoly on patronage and its control of the media, especially in the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 1999|1999 general election]]. The [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 2009|most recent elections]] to the House of Representatives were held on 12 March 2009. The [[United Progressive Party (Antigua and Barbuda)|United Progressive Party]] government was re-elected with nine seats and supported by the sole member from Barbuda, affiliated to the [[Barbuda People''s Movement]]. The Antigua Labour Party has seven seats in the House of Representatives.

Constitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association. Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the eastern Caribbean court system. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.
Jurisprudence is based on English [[common law]].

==Executive branch==
As head of state, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] is represented in [[Antigua and Barbuda]] by a governor general who acts on the advice of the prime minister and the cabinet.

The ''''''economy of American Samoa'''''' is a traditional [[Polynesia]]n economy in which more than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic activity is strongly linked to the [[United States]], with which American Samoa conducts the great bulk of its [[foreign trade]]. [[Tuna]] [[Commercial fishing|fishing]] and [[Fish processing|processing]] plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna being the primary export. Transfers from the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] add substantially to American Samoa''s economic well-being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa''s remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. [[Tourism]], a developing sector, may be held back by the current financial difficulties in [[East Asia]].

The word ''''''''''abbot'''''''''', meaning father, is a [[title]] given to the head of a [[monastery]] in various traditions, including [[Christianity]].  This article is intended to present facts related to the role and history associated with abbots in Christianity.

==Origins==
The title had its origin in the [[monastery|monasteries]] of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]], spread through the eastern [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]], and soon became accepted generally in all languages as the designation of the head of a monastery.

In [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[mythology]], and [[fiction]], the ''''''afterlife'''''' (also referred to as ''''''life after death'''''' or the ''''''Hereafter'''''') is the concept of a realm, or the realm itself (whether physical or [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]]), in which an [[essence|essential part]] of an individual''s identity or consciousness continues to reside after [[death|the death of the body]] in the individual''s [[World (theology)|lifetime]].

Throughout history, forms of [[art]] have gone through periodic abrupt changes called ''''''artistic revolutions''''''.  Movements have come to an end to be replaced by a new movement markedly different in striking ways.  See also [[cultural movement]]s.

== Artistic revolution and cultural/political revolutions ==

The role of [[fine art]] has been to simultaneously express values of the current culture while also offering criticism, balance, or alternatives to any such values that are proving no longer useful. So as times change, art changes. If changes were abrupt they were deemed revolutions. The best artists have predated society''s changes due not to any prescIence, but because sensitive perceptivity is part of their ''talent'' of seeing.

Artists have had to ''see'' issues clearly in order to satisfy their current clients, yet not offend potential patrons. For example, paintings glorified aristocracy in the early 17th century when leadership was needed to nationalize small political groupings, but later as leadership became oppressive, satirization increased and subjects were less concerned with leaders and more with more common plights of mankind.

In its origins and its first golden age, no art owes quite as much to state power as French painting does. It was in the age of absolute monarchy launched by Louix XIV in the 17th century that the likes of Poussin and Le Brun put France in the forefront of European art.

== Java influences ==

In which aspects was Java influenced by Ada, and Ada 2005 influenced by Java? --[[User:Abdull|Abdull]] ([[User talk:Abdull|talk]]) 23:27, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

: The big one was that Ada 2005 has Java-like interfaces.--[[User:Prosfilaes|Prosfilaes]] ([[User talk:Prosfilaes|talk]]) 07:29, 14 September 2010 (UTC)

::That can''t be true. The interfaces are from Ada 83, and at that time Java wasn''t even conceived in a mystical hallucination. Of course Java borrowed it from Ada 83!

== Was the analytical engine ever built? ==

The history of computers page says that the analytical engine was never built, this page at least implies that it was. Which is correct? .charles Babbage

:It was never built. His son built a part of it (arithmetical unit and printer) which  the most important control unit which would make it programmable. I''ll clarify that. --AxelBoldt

:As far as I understand, his son build a 4-function calculator with printer by his own design (derived from Babbage''s mill). And Babbage did build part of the mill including the printer, but this is a different machine. The latter can be recognized as having many horizontal racks in it and several cam wheels in front of it.[[User:Svenpb|SvenPB]] 14:43, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

This page states that the analytical engine was a hundred years ahead of comperable...computers. Were there other computer at the time of the analytical engine? Or was it the technological equivalent of computers that would be built a century later?   --rmhermen

:There were no other computers at the time. The first comparable ones appeared 100 years later. --AxelBoldt

:The key to Babbage''s idea was to seperate calculation and memory. This was only reinvented a century later. In Babbage''s time non-programmable calculators were build. Schickard''s and Leibniz'' machines could multiply. Schickard used the principle of Napier''s bones. Leibniz used the principle of the stepped drum. And Schultz actually build a difference machine in Babbage''s time. Babbage and Schultz have also met. Schultz'' machine looks ok, but as I understand it was not very well thought out and didn''t work very well (for example the position of the wheels wasn''t defined. Babbage''s used springs for that. In general Babbage''s machines are not matched by any other design from a mechanical point of view).[[User:Svenpb|SvenPB]] 14:38, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

This article will go through a wide range of topics of the ''''''geography of the state of [[Alabama]]''''''. It is 30th in size and borders four [[U.S. state]]s: Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida. It also borders the Gulf of Mexico.

==Physical features==
{{see also|Geology of Alabama}}
Extending entirely across the state of Alabama for about {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} northern boundary, and in the middle stretching {{convert|60|mi|km|0}} farther south, is the [[Cumberland Plateau]], or [[Tennessee Valley]] region, broken into broad tablelands by the dissection of rivers. In the northern part of this plateau, west of [[Jackson County, Alabama|Jackson county]], there are about {{convert|1000|sqmi|km2}} of level highlands from {{convert|700|to|800|ft|m|-1}} above sea level. South of these highlands, occupying a narrow strip on each side of the [[Tennessee River]], is a country of gentle rolling lowlands varying in elevation from {{convert|500|to|800|ft|m|-1}}.  To the northeast of these highlands and lowlands is a rugged section with steep mountain-sides, deep narrow coves and valleys, and flat mountain-tops.  Its elevations range from {{convert|400|to|1800|ft|m|-1}}.  In the remainder of this region, the southern portion, the most prominent feature is ''''Little Mountain'''', extending about {{convert|80|mi|km|0}} from east to west between two valleys, and rising precipitously on the north side {{convert|500|ft|m|-1}} above them or {{convert|1000|ft|m}} above the sea.

Adjoining the Cumberland Plateau region on the southeast is the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians|Appalachian Valley]] (locally known as Coosa Valley) region, which is the southern extremity of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], and occupies an area within the state of about {{convert|8000|sqmi|km2|-3}}.  This is a [[limestone]] belt with parallel hard rock ridges left standing by erosion to form mountains.  Although the general direction of the mountains, ridges, and valleys is northeast and southwest, irregularity is one of the most prominent characteristics.  In the northeast are several flat-topped mountains, of which Raccoon and [[Lookout Mountain|Lookout]] are the most prominent, having a maximum elevation near the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] line of little more than {{convert|1800|ft|m|-1}} and gradually decreasing in height toward the southwest, where [[Sand Mountain (Alabama)|Sand Mountain]] is a continuation of Raccoon.  South of these the mountains are marked by steep northwest sides, sharp crests and gently sloping southeast sides.

Southeast of the Appalachian Valley region, the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Plateau]] also crosses the Alabama border from the N.E. and occupies a small triangular-shaped section of which [[Randolph County, Alabama|Randolph]] and [[Clay County, Alabama|Clay]] counties, together with the northern part of [[Tallapoosa County, Alabama|Tallapoosa]] and [[Chambers County, Alabama|Chambers]], form the principal portion.  Its surface is gently undulating and has an elevation of about {{convert|1000|ft|m|-2}} above sea level.  The Piedmont Plateau is a lowland worn down by erosion on hard crystalline rocks, then uplifted to form a plateau.

The remainder of the state is occupied by the ''''Coastal Plain''''.  This is crossed by foot-hills and rolling prairies in the central part of the state, where it has a mean elevation of about {{convert|600|ft|m|-1}}, becomes lower and more level toward the southwest, and in the extreme south is flat and but slightly elevated above the sea.
The Cumberland Plateau region is drained to the west-northwest by the [[Tennessee River]] and its tributaries; all other parts of the state are drained to the southwest. In the Appalachian Valley region the [[Coosa River]] is the principal river; and in the Piedmont Plateau, the [[Tallapoosa River]].  In the Coastal Plain are the [[Tombigbee River]] in the west, the [[Alabama River]] (formed by the Coosa and Tallapoos')

[[File:Motorola 6800 Assembly Language.png|thumb|Motorola MC6800 Assembly Language]]
An ''''''assembly language'''''' is a [[low-level programming language]] for a [[computer]], or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong (generally [[one-to-one correspondence|one-to-one]]) correspondence between the language and the [[computer architecture|architecture''s]] [[machine code]] [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]].  Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture, in contrast to most [[high-level programming language]]s, which are generally [[porting|portable]] across multiple systems.

Assembly language is converted into executable machine code by a [[utility program]] referred to as an ''''[[#Assembler|assembler]]''''; the conversion process is referred to as ''''assembly'''', or ''''assembling'''' the code. 

Assembly language uses a [[mnemonic]] to represent each low-level machine operation or [[opcode]].  Some opcodes require one or more [[operand#Computer science|operands]] as part of the instruction, and most assemblers can take labels and symbols as operands to represent addresses and constants, instead of [[hard coding]] them into the program.  ''''''Macro assemblers'''''' include a [[macro (computer science)|macroinstruction]] facility so that assembly language text can be pre-assigned to a name, and that name can be used to insert the text into other code. Many assemblers offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program development, to control the assembly process, and to aid [[debugging]].

[[Image:Bardentreffen 2009 2169.jpg|thumb|Eliana Burki playing the alphorn at the Bardentreffen festival in [[Nuremberg]] 2009.]]

The ''''''alphorn'''''' or ''''''alpenhorn'''''' or ''''''alpine horn'''''' is a [[Brass instrument|labrophone]], consisting of a wooden [[natural horn]] of [[bore (wind instruments)|conical bore]], having a wooden cup-shaped [[mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]], used by mountain dwellers in [[Swiss Alps|Switzerland]] and elsewhere. Similar wooden horns were used for [[communication]] in most mountainous regions of [[Europe]], from the [[French Alps]] to the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]].

For a long time, scholars believed that the alphorn had been derived from the Roman-Etruscan [[lituus]], because of their resemblance in shape, and because of the word ''''liti'''', meaning Alphorn in the dialect of [[Obwalden]]. There is no documented evidence for this theory, however, and, the word ''''liti'''' was probably borrowed from 16th-18th century writings in Latin, where the word ''''lituus'''' could describe various wind instruments, such as the [[natural horn|horn]], the [[crumhorn]], or the [[cornett]]. Swiss naturalist [[Conrad Gesner]] used the words ''''lituum alpinum'''' for the first known detailed description of the alphorn in his ''''De raris et admirandis herbis'''' in 1555. The oldest known document using the German word ''''Alphorn'''' is a page from a 1527 account book from the former [[Cistercian]] abbey St. Urban near [[Pfaffnau]] mentioning the payment of two [[Batzen]] for an itinerant alphorn player from the [[Valais]].

17th-19th century collections of alpine myths and legends suggest that alphorn-like instruments had frequently been used as signal instruments in village communities since medieval times or earlier, sometimes substituting for the lack of [[church bells]]. Surviving artifacts, dating back to as far as ca. AD 1400, include wooden [[Brass instrument|labrophones]] in their stretched form, like the alphorn, or coiled versions, such as the ''')

The Ampere is still a base unit: see [http://www.bipm.fr/enus/3_SI/base_units.html the page of the International Bureau of Measurement].

:Still? Are you expecting them to change it? -- [[User:Tim Starling|Tim Starling]] 13:28, Dec 16, 2003 (UTC)

::Yes. Once we are able to reliably count individual electrons, that will be a much more precise way of measuring many electrical quantities. Then I expect the [[Coulomb]] to become the base unit -- re-defined as containing some arbitrary number of electrons -- and the Ampere re-defined as one Coulomb per second. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 02:41, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)

{{Criminal law}}
At Common Law, an intentional act by one person that creates an apprehension in another of an imminent harmful or offensive contact.

An ''''''assault'''''' is carried out by a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent, present ability to cause the harm. It is both a crime and a tort and, therefore, may result in either criminal or civil liability. Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and Tort Law. There is, however, an additional Criminal Law category of assault consisting of an attempted but unsuccessful Battery. The term is often confused with [[Battery (crime)|battery]], which involves physical contact. The specific meaning of assault varies between countries, but can refer to an act that causes another to apprehend immediate and personal violence, or in the more limited sense of a threat of violence caused by an immediate show of force.')

== Definition of Assault in Australia ==
I believe the definition of Assault in Australia does not require actual violence (ie battery).  Assault in Australia only requires the apprehension of violence/contact.
Can someone else confirm this so I can change it.

Wouldn''t the term Atlantic be derived from the Atlas (person) not the architectural feature? -rmhermen

Question: Did Atlas hold the earth on his shoulders?  Original sources indicate he stood on the earth and held up the heavens.  Is holding the earth as well a modern retelling or does it have classical roots?

- The earth version dates at least from [[:Rennaissance|Rennaissance]] times, if not before.  Could the change have been due to ''artistic license''?  (Easier to draw someone holding the Earth than the sky.)  Or just a mistranslation?

This is an excellent example of the unpleasant fact that the world has changed since August, [[:1914|1914]].  There is almost nothing of any value in the 1911 encyclopedia''s geographical entries other than physical dimensions of the earth - and those are all too often in fathoms, which I''m sure you devotees of the SI system find as annoying as I find it''s appalling pope-baiting in the history articles.

The ''''''Eaglet'''''' is a character appearing in Chapter 2 and 3 of ''''[[Alice''s Adventures in Wonderland]]'''' by [[Lewis Carroll]], a reference to Edith Liddell, [[Alice (Alice''s Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]''s sister.

In this passage Lewis Carroll incorporated references to everyone present on the original boating expedition of July 4, 1862 during which Alice''s Adventures were first told, with Alice as [[Alice Liddell|herself]], and the others represented by birds: the [[Lory (Alice''s Adventures in Wonderland)|Lory]] was Lorina Liddell, the Eaglet was Edith Liddell, the [[Dodo (Alice''s Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]] was [[Lewis Carroll]], and the Duck was Rev. [[Robinson Duckworth]].

According to ''''The Annotated Alice'''', Carroll had originally had the characters dry off by having the Dodo lead them to a nearby house for towels. As they walked, only Alice, the Lory, and the Eaglet could keep up. This was a reference to a boating outing Carroll had with the three girls and their family. It began to rain and the group left for a nearby house. Carroll and the sisters got there first, as they walked the fastest. Carroll ultimately replaced this scene in the book with the Caucus race, as he felt that it would only have been funny to the people familiar with the incident.

''''''American Chinese cuisine'''''' refers to the style of food served by many [[Overseas Chinese restaurant|Chinese restaurants]] in the [[United States]]. This type of cooking typically caters to American tastes and differs significantly from [[Chinese cuisine|real Chinese cuisine]].

==History==
In the 19th century, Chinese in [[San Francisco]] operated sophisticated and sometimes luxurious restaurants patronized mainly by Chinese, while restaurants in smaller towns served what their customers requested, ranging from pork chop sandwiches and apple pie to beans and eggs. These smaller restaurants developed American Chinese cuisine when they modified their food to suit a more American palate. First catering to miners and railroad workers, they established new eateries in towns where Chinese food was completely unknown, adapting local ingredients and catering to their customers'' tastes.')

The ''''''Alexandrists'''''' were a school of [[Renaissance]] philosophers who, in the great controversy on the subject of personal immortality, adopted the explanation of the ''''De Anima'''' given by [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]].

According to the orthodox [[Thomism]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Aristotle]] rightly regarded reason as a facility of the individual soul. Against this, the Averroists, led by [[Agostino Nifo]], introduced the modifying theory that universal reason in a sense individualizes itself in each soul and then absorbs the active reason into itself again.  These two theories respectively evolved the doctrine of individual and universal immortality, or the absorption of the individual into the eternal One.

The Alexandrists, led by [[Pietro Pomponazzi]], boldly assailed these beliefs and denied that either was rightly attributed to Aristotle.  They held that Aristotle considered the soul as a material and therefore a mortal entity which operates during life only under the authority of universal reason.  Hence the Alexandrists denied the possibility of any form of immortality, holding that, since the soul is organically connected with the body, the dissolution of the latter involves the extinction of the former.

I can''t find out it Agnes was ever crowned.  If not, she was ''concubine of the King of France'', not queen. --MichaelTinkler
----
You can''t be a wife and still not be queen of France ?
concubine has connotations of illegitimacy...
-----
well, I have at least one too many ''nots'' in my comment.  Coronation of queens is tricky in the high middle ages - it actually wasn''t all that common - so yes, all legitimate wives were automatically queen.  If she had been crowned we *might* call her queen even if she was a concubine - Ingeborg was dismissed without coronation, we know, though evidently after consummation (or that''s what Ingeborg always stated in legal briefs).  It''s a problem.  We should probably just delete ''queen'' out of caution and leave her as ''wife or concubine...'' and let the article explain the ambiguity of the description. --MichaelTinkler

''''''The Triumph of Time'''''' is a poem by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], published in 1866. It is in adapted [[ottava rima]] and is full of elaborate use of literary devices, particularly [[alliteration]]. The theme, which purports to be autobiographical, is that of rejected love. The (male) speaker deplores the ruin of his life, and in tones at times reminiscent of ''''[[Hamlet]]'''', craves oblivion, for which the sea serves as a constant metaphor.

''''''''''The Triumph of Time'''''''''' is also the US title of [[James Blish]]''s novel ''''A Clash of Cymbals''''.

== Merge proposal ==

Initial proposals:

''''''I'''''' Nothing changes ([[Asteroid]] is an article, [[Minor planet]] is a different article)

''''''II'''''' [[Asteroid]] becomes main article, [[Minor planet]] is a redirect to it

''''''III'''''' [[Minor planet]] becomes main article, [[Asteroid]] is a redirect to it

''''''IV'''''' [[Asteroid]] is a disambiguation page, [[Minor planet]] remains an article and absorbs most of the material from current [[Asteroid]] article

''''''V'''''' [[Asteroid]] is a disambiguation page, [[Minor planet]] remains an article and current [[Asteroid]] article is renamed

I don''t know enough about the scientific uses of these terms to weigh in on any of the options myself (yet) but I do see that a merge has been proposed in the past but no real consensus has been reached, ''''and'''' I find the current state of affairs confusing (so I guess I at least know I don''t support option ''''''I''''''.)  --[[User:Sapphic|Sapphic]] 17:56, 10 October 2007 (UTC)

== Two antipope Benedicts XIVs? ==

Is there any evidence for the second Benedict XIV?  The standard sources (The Oxford Dictionary of Popes, The Catholic Encyclopedia, the Liber Pontificalis) are silent about him, the source seems to be a novel, and, most importantly, it makes no sense for a successor to style himself identically to the person he is succeeding.  There were two Pope Benedict XIVs, one a pope and one an antipope, but I''m not buying the story about Carrier...

:According to the article about the anti-pope Benedict XIV, Carrier, styled a cardinal, elected Garnier by himself.If he was the cardinal who elected Benedict XIV, how could he be the preceding anti-pope?

''''''Athenian democracy'''''' developed in the  Greek [[city-state]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]], comprising the central city-state of Athens and the surrounding territory of [[Attica]], around 550 BC. Athens is one of the first known democracies. Other Greek cities set up democracies, and even though most followed an Athenian model, none were as powerful, stable, nor as well-documented as that of Athens.

It remains a unique and intriguing experiment in [[direct democracy]], a political system in which the people do not elect representatives to vote on their behalf but vote on legislation and executive bills in their own right. Participation was by no means open, but the in-group of participants was constituted with no reference to economic class and they participated on a large scale. The [[public opinion]] of voters was remarkably influenced by the [[political satire]] performed by the [[Ancient Greek comedy|comic poets]] at the [[Ancient Greek theatre|theatres]].')

The Arabic numerals (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) are used worldwide.
They were popularized by the arabs, but were originally used by the early phonecian traders.

The phonecian numerals represented the count of angles in each of their symbols.
For example, 0 has no angle; 1 has one angle, 2 has two angles, 3 has three angles etc.

Go to http://www.orthohelp.com/number.htm to see what these symbols look like.

==Dionysius==
In standard mythology, Apollo and Dionysius are not brothers; they are half-brothers, but then so are Apollo and Ares, Apollo and Hermes, Apollo and almost half the gods out there.  The idea that the two are complementary is not in the mainstream of mythology, and so probably stems from one of the mystery cults, in which case the source should be attributed, since there are often considerable differences in these (e.g. Dionysius and the Titans).  Nothing I have ever seen suggests Dionysius has anything to do with Delphi, so that probably should be attributed as well.  Besides, I''m interested to know!

:The tomb of Dionysius was acually inside the adyton of the Apollo temple at Delphi.  Clea, Priestess to Apollo, lead the secret Dionysian rites from Delphi to the Korykian cave, 7 miles up the slope of Mount Parnassos, in the winter months when Apollo was said to be absent from Delphi.  Men were not allowed to witness these women''s rites, altough some are thought to have been chosen for the role of satyrs.

An ''''''affix'''''' is a [[morpheme]] that is attached to a word [[stem (linguistics)|stem]] to form a new word. Affixes may be [[derivation (linguistics)|derivational]], like English ''''-ness'''' and ''''pre-'''', or [[inflection]]al, like English plural ''''-s'''' and past tense ''''-ed''''. They are [[bound morpheme]]s by definition; prefixes and suffixes may be [[separable affix]]es. Affixation is, thus, the linguistic process speakers use to form different words by adding morphemes (affixes) at the beginning (prefixation), the middle (infixation) or the end (suffixation) of words.

==Positional categories of affixes==
Affixes are divided into plenty of categories, depending on their position with reference to the stem. ''''Prefix'''' and ''''suffix'''' are extremely common terms. ''''Infix'''' and ''''circumfix'''' are less so, as they are not important in European languages. The other terms are uncommon.

An ''''''ambush'''''' is a long-established [[military tactics|military tactic]], in which the aggressors (the ambushing force) take advantage of concealment and the [[element of surprise]] to attack an unsuspecting enemy from concealed positions, such as among dense [[underbrush]] or behind [[hill]]tops. Ambushes have been used consistently throughout history, from [[ancient warfare|ancient]] to [[modern warfare]].

==History==
In ancient times, an ambush often might involve thousands of soldiers on a large scale, such as over a [[mountain pass]]. Ambushes appear many times in  military history. One outstanding example from ancient times is the [[Battle of the Trebia]] river. Hannibal encamped within striking distance of the Romans with the Trebia River between them, and placed a strong force of cavalry and infantry in concealment, near the battle zone. He had noticed, says Polybius, a ''''')

Abzymes are usually artificial constructs, but are also found in normal humans (anti-vasoactive intestinal peptide autoantibodies) and in patients with [[autoimmune diseases]] such as systemic [[lupus erythematosus]], where they can bind to and hydrolyze [[DNA]]. Abzymes are potential tools in [[biotechnology]], e.g., to perform specific actions on DNA. They are also useful in hydrolysis of esters. Rate of hydrolysis was increased 100 times. 

Enzymes function by lowering the activation energy of the transition state, thereby catalyzing the formation of an otherwise less-favorable molecular intermediate between reactants and products.   If an antibody is developed to stabilize a molecule that''s similar to an unstable intermediate of another (potentially unrelated) reaction, the developed antibody will enzymatically bind to and stabilize the intermediate state, thus catalyzing the reaction. A new and unique type of enzyme is produced.

{{General geometry}}
''''''Algebraic geometry'''''' is a branch of [[mathematics]], classically studying zeros of [[polynomial equations]]. Modern algebraic geometry is based on more abstract techniques of [[abstract algebra]], especially [[commutative algebra]], with the language and the problems of [[geometry]].

The fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], which are geometric manifestations of [[solution set|solutions]] of [[systems of polynomial equations]]. Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are: [[plane algebraic curve]]s, which include [[line (geometry)|lines]], [[circle]]s, [[parabola]]s, [[ellipse]]s, [[hyperbola]]s, [[cubic curve]]s like [[elliptic curve]]s and quartic curves like [[lemniscate of Bernoulli|lemniscate]]s, and [[Cassini oval]]s. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the [[singular point of a curve|singular point]]s, the [[inflection point]]s and the [[point at infinity|points at infinity]]. More advanced questions involve the [[topology]] of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations.

Algebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as [[complex analysis]], [[topology]] and [[number theory]]. Initially a study of [[systems of polynomial equations]] in several variables, the subject of algebraic geometry starts where [[equation solving]] leaves off, and it becomes even more important to understand the intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations, than to find a specific solution; this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.')

The ''''''argument from morality'''''' is an argument for the [[existence of God]]. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that [[God]] is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Argument from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it.

German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] devised an argument from morality based on [[practical reason]]. Kant argued that the goal of humanity is to achieve perfect happiness and virtue (the [[summum bonum]]) and believed that an [[afterlife]] must exist in order for this to be possible, and that God must exist to provide this. Both theist and nontheist philosophers have accepted that, if objective moral truths exist, then God must too exist; the argument from moral objectivity asserts that objective moral truths do exist, and that God must exist too. In his book ''''[[Mere Christianity]]'''', [[C. S. Lewis]] argued that')

It originated in [[Nebraska City, Nebraska]], [[United States]] by [[Julius Sterling Morton|J. Sterling Morton]]. The first Arbor Day was held on April 10, 1872 and an estimated one million trees were planted that day. Many countries now observe a similar holiday. Though usually observed in the spring, the date varies, depending on [[climate]] and suitable planting season.

The ''''''Amber Road'''''' is a hypothetical ancient [[trade route]] for the transfer of [[amber]] from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

An important raw material, amber was transported from the [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic Sea]] coasts overland by way of the [[Vistula]] and [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] rivers to [[Italy]], [[Greece]], the [[Black Sea]], and [[Egypt]] thousands of years ago, and long after.

In [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, a main route ran south from the Baltic coast in through the land of the [[Boii]] (modern [[Czech Republic]]  and  [[Slovakia]]) to the head of the [[Adriatic Sea]] (modern [[Gulf of Venice]]).  The Egyptian pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]] had Baltic amber among his burial goods,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} and amber was sent from the North Sea to the temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]] as an offering. From the [[Black Sea]], trade could continue to Asia along the [[Silk Road]], another ancient trade route.

The [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]] towns of [[Mokhovoye|Kaup]] and [[Truso]] on the Baltic were the starting points of the route to the south. In [[Scandinavia]] the amber road probably gave rise to the thriving [[Nordic Bronze Age]] culture, bringing influences from the Mediterranean Sea to the northernmost countries of Europe.

The entry says that St. Adalbert was born 939. I looked in Britannica and it says 956. Who is right? --[[User:css|css]]
----


To css !!
I got the date of 939 for birth of St Adalbert from the Catholic Encyclopedia, New Advent
(They show 939- 997 , but positioned at the wrong St Adalbert. They list several.)

The date of birth does not make any difference to me in the story and I am taking it out.
I found several articles at www.weptop.com . Some say he was martyred at the Pomeranian coast.
That is  incorrect, because it was the Samland coast . Samland in Prussia has never been Pomerania . Danzig , where he started out in Prussia, was christianised from the west from Pomerania and was at times ruled by the Pomerelian ( Little Pomeranian) dukes ,even though it was situated in Old Prussi Land. But the Eastern part of Prussia was Christianised from Riga in Livland Livonia ( today Latvia) and was under the archbishopric of Riga.
--------------
I removed the ''loss of land and freedom'' part.  Christianization, IF it was combined with conquest by a neighboring Lord, might have meant loss of ''freedom''.  Plenty of people converted without ''loss of freedom''.  Lots of these north German entries seem to imply that the Prussians were noble savages (I''m especially amused by the idea that they fought with clubs because clubs were ''less final'' than swords - that implies that fighting with clubs was a positive thing and that these noble savages were corrupted by their wicked, sword-using neighbors.  That''s all arrant speculation.  If they didn''t use swords it was because they were so poor and so metallurgically unsophisticated that they couldn''t.  People always use the best weapons they can afford.).
---------------------------------------
Christianization did mean loss of land and freedom . Read the book about the Baltic or Northern Crusades at amazon.com.

Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and the [[Hindu astrology|Indians]], [[Chinese astrology|Chinese]], and [[Mayans]] developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations.

Folklore consists of legends, music, oral history, proverbs, jokes, popular beliefs, fairy tales, stories, tall tales, and customs that are the traditions of a culture, subculture, or group. It is also the set of practices through which those expressive genres are shared. The study of folklore is sometimes called folkloristics. In usage, there is a continuum between folklore and mythology.

''''''American folklore'''''', encompasses the folk traditions that have evolved on the [[North America]]n continent since [[Europe]]ans arrived in the 16th century. While it contains much in the way of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tradition, it should not be confused with the tribal beliefs of any community of native people.

==Native American folklore==
[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures are rich in myths and legends that explain natural phenomena and the relationship between humans and the spirit world. Native American cultures are numerous and diverse. Though some neighboring cultures hold similar beliefs, others can be quite different from one another. The most common myths are the creation myths, that tell a story to explain how the earth was formed, and where humans and other beings came from. Others may include explanations about the sun, moon, constellations, specific animals, seasons, and weather. This is one of the ways that many tribes have kept, and continue to keep, their cultures alive; these stories are not told simply for entertainment, but as a way of preserving and transmitting the nation, tribe or band''s particular beliefs, history, customs, spirituality and traditional way of life. There are many different kinds of stories. Some are called')

In [[computer science]], the ''''''analysis of algorithms'''''' is the determination of the number of resources (such as time and storage) necessary to execute them. Most [[algorithm]]s are designed to work with inputs of arbitrary length. Usually the efficiency or running time of an algorithm is stated as a function relating the input length to the number of steps ([[time complexity]]) or storage locations (space complexity).

Algorithm analysis is an important part of a broader [[computational complexity theory]], which provides theoretical estimates for the resources needed by any algorithm which solves a given computational problem. These estimates provide an insight into reasonable directions of search for efficient algorithms.

In theoretical analysis of algorithms it is common to estimate their complexity in the asymptotic sense, i.e., to estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input. [[Big O notation]], [[Big-omega notation]] and [[Big-theta notation]] are used to this end. For instance, [[binary search]] is said to run in a number of steps proportional to the logarithm of the length of the list being searched, or in O(log(n)), colloquially')

The same case is used in many languages for the objects of (some or all) [[preposition]]s.  It is a noun that is having something done to it, usually joined (such as in [[Latin]]) with the [[nominative case]], making it an [[indirect object]].

The accusative case existed in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] and is present in some [[Indo-European languages]] (including [[Latin]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[German language|German]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]), in the [[Uralic languages]], in [[Altaic languages]], and in [[Semitic languages]] (such as [[Hebrew]] and [[Classical Arabic]]). [[Finnic languages]], such as Finnish and Estonian, have two cases to mark objects, the accusative and the [[partitive case]]. In [[morphosyntactic alignment]] terms, both perform the accusative function, but the accusative object is [[Telicity|telic]], while the partitive is not.

Modern [[English language|English]], which almost entirely lacks [[declension]] in its nouns, does not have an explicitly marked accusative case even in the pronouns.  Such forms as ''''whom'''', ''''them'''', and ''''her'''' derive rather from the old Germanic [[dative case|dative]] forms, of which the -m and -r endings are characteristic.  This conflation of the old accusative, dative, instrumental, and (after prepositions) genitive cases is the ''''[[oblique case]]''''.  Most modern English grammarians no longer use the Latin accusative/dative model, though they tend to use the terms ''''objective'''' for oblique, ''''subjective'''' for nominative, and ''''possessive'''' for genitive ''''(see [[Declension in English]]).''''  ''''Hine'''', a true accusative masculine third person singular pronoun, is attested in some northern English dialects as late as the 19th century.')

These were not ''armored cars'' in the sense implied by the modern term, as they provided no real protection for their crews against any kind of opposing fire. They were also, by virtue of their small capacity engines, far less efficient than the cavalry and horse-drawn guns that they were intended to complement.

An ''''''anode'''''' is an [[electrode]] through which [[electric current]] flows ''''into'''' a polarized electrical device. The direction of electric current is, by convention, opposite to the direction of electron flow. In other words, the electrons flow from the anode into, for example, an [[electrical circuit]]. [[Mnemonic]]: ACID (Anode Current Into Device). 

A widespread misconception is that anode [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] is always positive (+). This is often incorrectly inferred from the correct fact that in all electrochemical devices, negatively charged [[anion]]s move towards the anode (hence their name) and positively charged [[cation]]s move away from it. In fact anode polarity depends on the device type, and sometimes even in which mode it operates, as per the above electric current direction-based universal definition.  Consequently, as can be seen from the following examples, the anode is positive in a device that consumes power, and the anode is negative in a device that provides power:

Mmmm, it is very similar to Irish football, I wonder - was there significant Irish immigration in Australia at the time. {end sarcasm} Australian Rules = Irish Football played on a cricket pitch. It''s ironic that us Aussie''s love to play up AFL''s uniqueness, yet it''s uniqueness that gives away the fact that it''s a bastardisation of an immigrant sport that''s only played in one other country in the world. - CS
* This sort of comment shows a lack of understanding of the history of all football codes.  No one says that Australian Football wasn''t influenced by other codes, in fact, the reverse is true.  It was codified in 1859, which in the context of all the modern codes of football, is very early indeed.  It didn''t just appear out of thin air, in fact, we know a lot about the people that first played it and who first formulated the rudimentary rules.  Almost without exception, they had had exposure to the English public school system - which is where we are to find the roots of almost all the modern football codes.  However, during the 1840s and 1850s, they all had their own separate and different rules.  So Australian Football is unique in that it was codified so early in the piece and that it was an amalgam of the experience of various wealthy Australians in the English public school system.  The biggest influence was clearly the Rugby school (and those who know both sports well will also be familiar with a lot of the shared terminology that is used that is not to be found in the other codes).  However, all these different school rules can be categorised roughly into two groups:  those that relied predominantly on kicking the ball (precursor to Association Football) and those that relied predominantly on running with the ball (Rugby).  Both Australian and Gaelic football share the characteristic that they are a combination of both groups - but that doesn''t mean that one influenced the other - it''s simply what they both got out of the various rules that were doing the rounds at the time.  It is worth mentioning that the modern version of Gaelic Football was codified a good 30 years after Australian Football.  All football historians have found no evidence of Gaelic football being an influence on Australian football.  This is unsurprising - remembering that the first ones to play the game all had an English public school background - how many of them were going to put their hand up and say let''s play this Irish game I know!  This is not a partisan view, it is simply what we know of the history of the game.  Remember also that the first recorded game of Australian Football was between two wealthy protestant private schools - it is unlikely that any Catholics took the field that day!  --[[User:Pippu d''angelo|pippudoz]] - [[:scn:User talk:Pippu d''angelo|')

An ''''''alexandrine'''''' is a line of [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meter]] comprising 12 [[syllable]]s.  Alexandrines are common in the [[German literature]] of the [[German literature of the Baroque period|Baroque period]] and in [[List of French language poets|French poetry]] of the early modern and modern periods. [[Drama]] in English often used alexandrines before [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], by whom it was supplanted by [[iambic pentameter]] (5-foot verse).  In non-Anglo-Saxon or French contexts, the term [[dodecasyllable]] is often used.

==Syllabic verse==
In [[syllabic verse]], such as that used in [[French literature]], an alexandrine is a line of twelve syllables.  Most commonly, the line is divided into two equal parts by a [[caesura]] between the sixth and seventh syllables. Alternatively, the line is divided into three four-syllable sections by two caesuras.

The dramatic works of [[Pierre Corneille]] and [[Jean Racine]] are typically composed of rhyming alexandrine couplets. (The caesura after the 6th syllable is here marked || ).
Note that in these examples, as in the vast majority of pre-20th century French poetry, the pronunciation of the')

''''''Albrecht Altdorfer'''''' (c. 1480 - February 12, 1538)  was a German painter, engraver and architect of the Renaissance working in Regensburg. Along with [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and [[Wolf Huber]] he is regarded to be the main representative of the so-called [[Danube School]] setting biblical and historical subjects against landscape backgrounds of expressive colours. As an artist also making small intricate engravings he is seen to belong to the Nuremberg [[Little Masters]].

==Biography==
Altdorfer was born in [[Regensburg]] or [[Altdorf, Lower Bavaria|Altdorf]] around 1480.

He acquired an interest in art from his father, Ulrich Altdorfer, who was a painter and miniaturist. At the start of his career, he won public attention by creating small, intimate modestly scaled works in unconventional media and with eccentric subject matter. He settled in the [[free imperial city]] of Regensburg, a town located on the [[Danube River]] in 1505, eventually becoming the town architect and a town councillor. His first signed works date to c. 1506, including engravings and drawings such the ''''Stygmata of St. Francis'''' and ''''St. Jerome''''. His models were [[niello]]s and copper engravings from the workshops of [[Jacopo de Barbari]] and [[Albrecht D')

The article says ''some experts doubt that it is really as secure as it should be for important applications''.

Which experts?

-- [[User:The Anome|The Anome]]

-----

Bruce Schneier and Rich Schroeppel are two who come to mind. A few others seem to have vague doubts. I should point out that Rijndael has not actually been broken, and in fact it has been proven mathematically that some of the more popular methods can''t break it. The main worry is that the whole thing looks too simple, and has more algebraic structure than is normal for a block cipher. There is a possibility that some new kind of algebraic attack might exist.

If you trawl through the AES website, you can find the public comments, and quite a few there thought Rijndael was too simple. (Note that not all the comments are by experts though :-) When the final choice was announced, Schneier said')

Because I''m a medievalist and I have NO idea what an ''early form of evangelical Christianity'' practiced by a canonized saint at the end of the first millennium would have been.  Claiming that she was anything other than a Roman Catholic is - to say it moderately - odd. If what the author means is that having read the life of St. Adelaide he or she is impressed with her evident holiness, woo hoo!

The systematic name for this is listed as 2-acetyloxybenzoic acid. Shouldn''t that be 2-ethanoyloxybenzenecarboxylic acid? (Sorry if that sounds pedantic.)

I thought so as well, but PubChem and the CAS registry both say 2-acetyloxybenzoic acid. [[User:Bfesser|Bfesser]] 22:27, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

----

Small typographical correction: in the synthesis section, I changed ''acylated'' to ''acetylated''. -- Kurtis (not registered)

----

COX is short for cycloxygenase enzyme which catalyses the production of prostaglandins, prostacyclines and thromboxanes from arachidonic acid. Aspirin inhibits this enzyme---bon

----

Could someone please check the pharmacology of aspirin described here... I thought COX was a type of prostaglandin... --[[User:Dweir|Dweir]]
----
Nope, platelet cyclooxygenase is an enzyme that mediates the synthesis of prostaglandins (among other things) - I think there is a mistake though, in the platelet aggregation bit, in that it is thromboxane A2 (TXA2), also produced via a COX-mediated pathway, which is not a prostaglandin as stated, that increases platelet aggregation.  Will do a bit more research and maybe edit the article re: effects on MI -- Alex.

''''''Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)'''''' is a spectroanalytical procedure for the quantitative determination of chemical elements employing the absorption of optical radiation (light) by free atoms in the gaseous state. 

In analytical chemistry the technique is used for determining the concentration of a particular element (the analyte) in a sample to be analyzed. AAS can be used to determine over 70 different elements in solution or directly in solid samples employed in [[pharmacology]], [[biophysics]] and [[toxicology]] research.

Atomic absorption spectrometry was first used as an analytical technique, and the underlying principles were established in the second half of the 19th century by [[Robert Wilhelm Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Robert Kirchhoff]], both professors at the [[University of Heidelberg]], Germany. 

The modern form of AAS was largely developed during the 1950s by a team of Australian chemists. They were led  
by [[Alan Walsh (physicist)|Sir Alan Walsh]] at the [[CSIRO]] (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization), Division of Chemical Physics, in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].')

''''''Abatement of debts and legacies'''''' is a [[common law]] doctrine of [[will (law)|wills]] that holds that when the equitable [[assets]] of a deceased person are not sufficient to satisfy fully all the creditors, their debts must abate proportionately, and they must accept a [[dividend]].

In the case of legacies when the funds or assets out of which they are payable are not sufficient to pay them in full, the legacies abate in proportion, unless there is a priority given specially to any particular legacy. Annuities are also subject to the same rule as general legacies.

The order of abatement is usually:
# Intestate property
# The residuary of the estate
# General Devises--''''i.e.'''', cash gifts
# Demonstrative Devises--''''i.e.'''', cash gifts from a specific account, stocks, bonds, securities, etc...

In [[law]], ''''''affiliation '''''' (from [[Latin]] ''''ad-filiare'''', to [[Adoption|adopt]] as a son) is the term to describe a [[partnership]] between two or more [[Party (law)|parties]].

== Affiliation procedures in England ==
In England a number of [[statute]]s on the subject have been passed, the chief being the Bastardy Act of the Parliament of 1845, and the Bastardy Laws Amendment Acts of 1872 and 1873.
The mother of a [[Bastard (Law of England and Wales)|bastard]] may summon the putative father to petty sessions within 12 months of the [[Childbirth|birth]] (or at any later time if he is proved to have contributed to the child''s support within 12 months after the birth), and the justices, as after hearing evidence on both sides, may, if the mother''s evidence be corroborated in some material particular, adjudge the man to be the putative father] of the child, and order him to pay a sum not exceeding five shillings a week for its maintenance, together with a sum for expenses incidental to the birth, or the [[funeral]] expenses, if it has died before the date of order, and the costs of the proceedings.

ceases to be valid after the child reaches the age of 13, but the justices (also referred to as 
Gold writers under these circumstances) may in the order direct the payments to be continued until the child is 16 years of age.

An appeal to quarter sessions is open to the defendant, and a further appeal on questions of law to the [[King''s Bench]] by rule ''''nisi or certiorari''''. Should the child afterwards become chargeable to the [[parish]], the sum due by the father may be received by the parish officer.

When a bastard child, whose mother has not obtained an order, becomes chargeable to the parish, the guardians may proceed against the putative father for a contribution.

Any woman who is single, a widow, or a married woman living apart from her husband, may make an application for a summons, and it is immaterial where the child is begotten, provided it is born in England.

An application for a summons may be made before the birth of the child, but in this case the statement of the mother must be in the form of a sworn deposition. The defendant must be over 14 years of age. No agreement on the part of the woman to take a sum down in discharge of the liability of the father is a bar to the making of an affiliation order. In the case of twins it is usual to make separate applications and obtain separate summonses.

The Summary [[Jurisdiction]] Act (1879) makes due provision for the enforcement of an order of affiliation. In the case of [[soldier]]s an affiliation order cannot be enforced in the usual way, but by the [[Army]] Act (1881), if an order has been made against a soldier of the regular forces, and a copy of such order be sent to the secretary of state, he may order a portion of the soldier''s pay to be retained. There is no such special legislation with regard to [[sailor]]s in the [[Royal Navy]].

== Affiliation procedures in other countries ==

In the [[British colonies]], and in the states of the United States (with the (usually termed filiation) akin to that described above, by means of which a mother can obtain a contribution to the support of her illegitimate child from the putative father.

The amount ordered to be paid may subsequently be increased or diminished (1905; 94 N.Y. Supplt. 372). On the continent of Europe, however, the [[legislation]] of the various countries differs rather widely. France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Russia, Serbia and the [[canton of Geneva]] provide no means of inquiry into the paternity of an illegitimate child, and consequently all support of the child falls upon the mother; on the other hand, Germany, Austria, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the majority of the [[Swiss cantons]] provide for an inquiry into the paternity of illegitimate children, and the law casts a certain amoun')

To prevent this bill from passing into law, Charles had dissolved parliament in July 1679, and in the following October had [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogue]]d its successor, which became known as the [[Exclusion Bill Parliament]], without allowing it to meet.  He was then deluged with petitions urging him to call it together, and this agitation was opposed by Sir [[George Jeffreys]] and [[Francis Wythens]], who presented addresses expressing ''''abhorrence'''' of the ''''Petitioners,'''' and thus initiated the movement of the abhorrers, who supported the action of the king.')

''''''Asexual reproduction'''''' is a mode of [[reproduction]] by which offspring arise from a single parent, and inherit the genes of that parent only; it is reproduction which almost always does not involve [[meiosis]], [[ploidy]] reduction, or [[fertilization]].

''''''Acrylic paint'''''' is fast drying [[paint]] containing pigment suspension in [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] polymer [[emulsion]]. Acrylic paints can be diluted with water, but become water-resistant when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted (with water) or modified with acrylic gels, media, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a [[watercolor painting|watercolor]] or an [[oil painting]], or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media.

== History ==

As early as 1934 the first usable acrylic resin dispersion was developed by German chemical company [[BASF]], which was patented by [[Rohm and Haas]]. Between 1946 and 1949, [[Leonard Bocour]] and [[Sam Golden]] invented a solution acrylic paint under the brand [[Magna paint]]. These were [[mineral spirits|mineral spirit]]-based paints.')

+++ cycloalkanes  +++  I''ll accept the writers word for it that cycloalkanes are not a sub-category of alkanes **according to IUPAC**.  There is abundant *technical* literature that disagrees (and treats them as a sub-category).  (some of it, I''ll admit, is older).  So, if the consensus is that cycloalkanes are not alkanes then perhaps less should be said of them in this article.  Cycloalkanes certainly do NOT have the formula C(n)H(2n).  For instance the tetrahedral structure C4H4 or add a CH2 group onto each vertice, C10H16.  The formula given is only correct for mono-cyclic alkanes.

A ''''''file archiver'''''' is a [[computer program]] that combines a number of [[computer file|files]] together into one [[archive file]], or a series of archive files, for easier transportation or storage. Many file archivers employ [[archive format]]s that provide [[lossless data compression]] to reduce the size of the archive which is often useful for transferring a large number of individual files over a high [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] network like the Internet.

The most basic archivers just take a list of files and concatenate their contents sequentially into the archive. In addition the archive must also contain some information about at least the names and lengths of the originals, so that proper reconstruction is possible. Most archivers also store [[metadata]] about a file that the [[operat')

''''''Dual wielding'''''' is holding a [[tool]] or [[weapon]] in each hand.

==History==
In modern terms: the use of two guns at once, one in each hand, is most associated with the [[American Old West]], where [[revolver]]s holding only six rounds of ammunition were the highest capacity handguns readily available and reloading was a slow process. Being single action weapons, they needed to be cocked for each shot, so the [[rate of fire]] was also low, and while a shooter could [[Fanning (firearms)|fan]] his gun, this expended all his shots even faster and made him even more inaccurate than normal. Use of two guns was therefore a reasonable compromise, as this allowed one gun to be cocked as the other is being fired, in practical terms doubling the rate of fire and the available number of bullets.

There is some evidence that gunfighters of the Old West did not actually shoot two-handed. They would draw and fire with their strong hand, and when they had emptied the first gun, they drew the second gun with their weak hand and passed it over to their strong hand. In modern firearms terminology this is often called a')

== RFC on Spirituality section ==

First of all, I dont know how to do an official RFC, and I am not sure the issue is large enough to make some official request. I have been moving down the article slowing the last months, trying to improve both content and grammar. I am now approaching the [[Anabaptist#Spirituality|Spirituality]] section. I see this section as an [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|undue weight]] issue. The charismatic manifestations are not what Anabaptism is usually noted for, in fact, in my dozens of books on Anabaptism I cannot think of one of them that even addresses these manifestations. The Holy Spirit Leadership would have a little more weight to it, but again it was not one of the core issues on which Anabaptism was founded upon. I therefore propose removing these two points and replacing them with other points (Gelassenheit would definitely be one, as well as nachfolge), or at least make only a passing mention at best. Before doing this, I would like comments from other editors. Thanks! [[User:Mikeatnip|Mikeatnip]] ([[User talk:Mikeatnip|talk]]) 02:46, 2 September 2012 (UTC)

Throughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union had been developing a series of missile systems with the ability to shoot down incoming [[ICBM]] warheads.  During this period the US considered the defense of the US as a part of reducing the overall damage inflicted in a full nuclear exchange.  As part of this defense, [[Canada]] and the US established the North American Air Defense Command (now called North American Aerospace Defense Command [[NORAD]]).

An ''''''autonomous building'''''' is a building designed to be operated independently from [[infrastructure|infrastructural]] support services such as the [[electric power]] grid, [[gas grid]], municipal water systems, [[sewage treatment]] systems, [[storm drain]]s, communication services, and in some cases, public roads.

Advocates of autonomous building describe advantages that include reduced environmental impacts, increased security, and lower costs of ownership. Some cited advantages satisfy tenets of [[green building]], not independence per se (see below). [[Off-the-grid|Off-grid]] buildings often rely very little on civil services and are therefore safer and more comfortable during civil disaster or military attacks. (Off-grid buildings would not lose power or water if public supplies were compromised for some reason.)

In a [[computer]]''s central processing unit ([[central processing unit|CPU]]), an ''''''accumulator'''''' is a [[processor register|register]] in which intermediate [[arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic and logic]] results are stored. Without a register like an accumulator, it would be necessary to write the result of each calculation (addition, multiplication, shift, etc.) to [[primary storage|main memory]], perhaps only to be read right back again for use in the next operation. Access to main memory is slower than access to a register like the accumulator because the technology used for the large main memory is slower (but cheaper) than that used for a register.

The canonical example for accumulator use is summing a list of numbers. The accumulator is initially set to zero, then each number in turn is read and added to the value in the accumulator. Only when all numbers have been added is the result held in the accumulator written to main memory or to another, non-accumulator, CPU register.

An ''''''accumulator machine'''''', also called a [[Instruction_set_architecture#Number_of_operands|1-operand machine]], or a CPU with ''''accumulator-based architecture'''', is a kind of CPU where, although it may have several registers, the CPU mostly stores the results of calculations in one special register, typically called')

An afterglow may appear above the highest [[cloud]]s in the hour of deepening [[twilight]], or [[reflection (optics)|reflected]] from the high [[snow]]fields in [[mountain]] regions long after [[sunset]]. The particles produce a [[scattering]] effect upon the component parts of [[white]] [[light]].  

After the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa|eruption]] of the [[volcano]] [[Krakatoa]] in 1883, a remarkable series of red [[sunset]]s appeared worldwide. These were due to an enormous amount of exceedingly fine dust blown to a great height by the volcano''s explosion, and then globally diffused by the high atmospheric currents.

''''''Arteriovenous malformation'''''' or ''''''AVM'''''' is an abnormal connection between [[arteries]] and [[veins]], bypassing the [[capillary system]]. This [[vascular anomaly]] is widely known because of its occurrence in the [[central nervous system]], but can appear in any location. Although many AVMs are asymptomatic, they can cause intense pain or bleeding or lead to other serious medical problems.   

AVMs are usually [[congenital]] and belong to the [[RASopathy|RASopathies]].
The genetic transmission patterns of AVM, if any, are unknown. AVM is not generally thought to be an inherited disorder, unless in the context of a specific hereditary [[syndrome]].

==History==

Emmanuel, Luschka and Virchow first described arteriovenous malformations in the mid-1800s. Olivecrona performed the first surgical excision of an intracranial AVM in 1932.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of AVM vary according to the location of the malformation. Roughly 88%')

''''''Amblypoda'''''' is a taxonomic hypothesis uniting a group of extinct, herbivorous [[mammal]]s. They were considered a suborder of the primitive [[ungulate]] mammals and have since been shown to represent a [[polyphyletic]] group.

==Characteristics==
The Amblypoda take their name from their short and stumpy feet, which were furnished with five toes each and supported massive pillar-like limbs. The brain cavity was extremely small and insignificant in comparison to the bodily mass, which was equal to that of the largest [[rhinoceros]]es. These animals were, in fact, descendants of the small ancestral ungulates that retained all the primitive characteristics of the latter, accompanied by a huge increase in body size. 

The Amblypoda were confined to the [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]] periods and occurred in [[North America]], [[Asia]] (especially [[Mongolia]]) and [[Europe]]. The cheek teeth were short-crowned ([[brachyodont]]), with the tubercles more-or-less completely fused into transverse ridges, or cross-crests ([[lophodont]] type), and the total number of teeth was in one case the typical 44, but in another was fewer. The [[vertebra]] of the neck unite on nearly flat surfaces, the [[humerus]] had lost the foramen, or perforation, at the lower end, and the third trochanter to the [[femur]] may have also been wanting. In the forelimb, the upper and lower series of [[carpal]] (finger) bones scarcely alternated, but in the hind foot, the astragalus overlapped the cuboid, while the [[fibula]], which was quite distinct from the [[tibia]] (as was the [[radius (bone)|radius]] from the [[ulna]] in the forelimb), articulated with both astragalus and calcaneum.

==Types of amblypods==
The most generalized type was ''''[[Coryphodon]]'''', representing the family [[Coryphodontidae]], from the lower Eocene of Europe and North America, in which there were 44 teeth and no horn-like excrescences on the long skull, while the femur had a third trochanter. The canines were somewhat elongated and were followed by a short gap in each jaw, and the cheek-teeth were adapted for succulent food. The length of the body reached about six feet in some cases. 

In the middle Eocene formations of North America occurred the more specialized ''''[[Uintatherium]]'''' (or ''''Dinoceras''''), typifying the family [[Uintatheriidae]]. Uintatheres were huge creatures with long narrow skulls, of which the elongated facial portion carried three pairs of bony horn-cores, probably covered with short horns in life, the hind-pair having been much the largest. The dental formula was i. 0/3, c. 1/1, p.')

[[Image:Apachebeadloom1903.png|thumb|355px|An old bead loom. 1. Roller. 2. Roller end. 3. Spacers. 4. Spacers.]]

When weaving on a loom, the beads are locked in between the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] threads by the [[weft]] threads.  The most common bead weaving technique requires two passes of the weft thread.  First, an entire row of beads is strung on the weft [[yarn|thread]].  Then the beads are pressed in between the warp threads.  The [[Sewing needle|needle]] is passed back through the beads above the warp threads to lock the beads into place. Heddle looms were popular near the beginning of the 20th century.

The [[Thorne system (1992)]] placed the order in superorder ''''[[Commelinanae]]'''' in subclass ''''[[Liliidae]]'''' [=monocotyledons].

The [[Dahlgren system]] placed the order in superorder ''''[[Bromelianae]]'''' in subclass ''''[[Liliidae]]'''' [=monocotyledons].

[[Botswana]] has put a premium on economic and political integration in southern [[Africa]]. It has sought to make [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]] a working vehicle for economic development, and it has promoted efforts to make the region [[self-policing]] in terms of preventative diplomacy, conflict resolution, and [[good governance]]. It has welcomed post-apartheid [[South Africa]] as a partner in these efforts. Botswana joins the African consensus on most major international matters and is a member of international organizations such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[African Union]]. Botswana is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).

[[Brunei]] joined [[ASEAN]] on January 7, 1984, one week after resuming full independence, and gives its ASEAN membership the highest priority in its foreign relations. Brunei joined the [[United Nations]] in September 1984. It also is a member of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC), the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) forum and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Brunei hosted the APEC Economic Leaders'' Meeting in November 2000. In 2005 it attended the inaugural [[East Asia Summit]].

Brunei has a number of [[Bruneian diplomatic missions|diplomatic missions abroad]] and has close relations with [[Singapore]], sharing an interchangeable currency regime as well as close military relations with the latter island-state. Aside from relations with other ASEAN states, Brunei also has extensive relations with the Islamic and Arab world.

==Bilateral relations==

===Australia===
{{Flag icon|Brunei}}{{Flag icon|Australia}}

Australia and Brunei Darussalam enjoy a warm, and increasingly diverse bilateral relationship. The Australian High Commission in Bandar Seri Begawan was established shortly before Brunei gained full independence in 1984, but relations go back much earlier than this. Australian servicemen liberated Brunei from Japanese occupation in June 1945. A memorial marking this event can be found at Muara Beach and is the venue for the annual ANZAC Day ceremony organised by the High Commission. Both countries are also participating in the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations which commenced in 2010, with participants aiming to conclude an agreement which will serve as a building block for Asia Pacific economic integration.

Brunei has a high commission in [[Canberra]], and Australia has a high commission in [[Bandar Seri Begawan]]. Both countries are full members of the Commonwealth of Nations.

==Political landscape after the civil war==
The political landscape of Burundi has been dominated in recent years by the [[civil war]] and a long [[Peacebuilding|peace process]] and move to [[democracy]].  The current [[President of Burundi]] is [[Pierre Nkurunziza]], a former rebel leader of the [[Hutu]] [[National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy]] who was [[Burundi elections, 2005|elected unopposed]] as the new [[Rulers and heads of state of Burundi|President of Burundi]] by the [[Parliament of Burundi|parliament]] on 19 August 2005.

In November 1995, the presidents of [[Burundi]], [[Rwanda]], [[Uganda]], and [[Zaire]] (currently [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]) announced a regional initiative for a negotiated peace in Burundi facilitated by former Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]].

[[Burundi]]''s relations with its neighbours have often been affected by security concerns. Hundreds of thousands of Burundian [[refugee]]s have at various times crossed to neighboring [[Rwanda]], [[Tanzania]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Hundreds of thousands of Burundians are in neighboring countries as a result of the ongoing civil war. Most of them, more than 340,000 since 1993, are in Tanzania. Some Burundian rebel groups have used neighboring countries as bases for insurgent activities. The 1993 embargo placed on Burundi by regional states hurt diplomatic relations with its neighbors; relations have improved since the 1999 suspension of these sanctions.

Burundi is a member of various international and regional organizations, including the [[United Nations]], the [[African Union]], the [[African Development Bank]] and the [[Francophonie]]. Burundi is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]). The Swedish [[Minister for Integration and Gender Equality]], [[Nyamko Sabuni]], was born in Burundi.

Burundi and [[Rwanda]] dispute sections of border on the [[Akanyaru River|Akanyaru]] and the [[Kagera River|Kagera]]/[[Nyabarongo River|Nyabarongo]] rivers, which have changed course since the 1960s, when the boundary was delimited; cross-border conflicts among [[Tutsi]], [[Hutu]], other ethnic groups, associated political rebels, armed gangs, and various government forces persist in the Great Lakes region.

Ok lets get this straight. Byzantium was born on Christmas eve... it''s power was at its height in 1025, but her territorial extent was greatest under Justinian I''s reign. We don''t give a damn what a few Historians (a minority) say when Byzantium was born. Either way, eve if Byzantium was born at Heracliu''s reign, than it is a Byzantium with Egypt, Syria, Palestine and north Africa that is territorially at a maximum, not in 1025 when she was the most powerful, but not the greatest in territorial extent.

A ''''''beacon'''''' is an intentionally conspicuous device designed to attract attention to a specific location.

Beacons can also be combined with semaphoric or other indicators to provide important [[information]], such as the status of an airport, by the colour and rotational pattern of its [[aerodrome beacon|airport beacon]], or of pending weather as indicated on a [[weather beacon]] mounted at the top of a tall building or similar site. When used in such fashion, beacons can be considered a form of [[Telegraph#Optical_telegraph|optical telegraphy]].

==For navigation==
[[File:Beacon at Orontes Bank.jpg|right|thumb|A navigational beacon denoting the presence of Orontes Bank off [[Port Vincent, South Australia]].]] 

Beacons help guide [[navigation|navigators]] to their destinations. Types of navigational beacons include [[radar]] reflectors, [[radio beacons]], sonic and visual signals. Visual beacons range from small, single-pile structures to large [[lighthouse]]s or light stations and can be located on land or on water. Lighted beacons are called ''''lights''''; unlighted beacons are called ''''daybeacon''''s.

''''Beaconing'''' is the process that allows a network to self-repair network problems. The stations on the network notify the other stations on the ring when they are not receiving the transmissions. Beaconing is used in Token ring and FDDI networks.

==For defensive communications==
[[File:Culmstock, Culmstock Beacon - geograph.org.uk - 213525.jpg|thumb|left|16th-century beacon hut in Culmstock, Devon, England]]

Classically, beacons were fires lit at well-known locations on hills or high places, used either as [[lighthouse]]s for [[navigational aid|navigation at sea]], or for signalling over land that enemy troops were approaching, in order to alert defenses. As signals, beacons are an ancient form of [[optical telegraph]]y, and were part of a [[relay league]].

A ''''''book'''''' is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of [[ink]], [[paper]], [[parchment]], or other materials, usually fastened together to hinge at one side. A single sheet within a book is called a [[Recto|leaf]], and each side of a leaf is called a [[page (paper)|page]]. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or [[e-book]].

Books may also refer to works of literature, or a main division of such a work. In [[library and information science]], a book is called a [[monograph]], to distinguish it from serial [[periodical]]s such as [[magazine]]s, [[academic journal|journal]]s or [[newspaper]]s. The body of all written works including books is [[literature]]. In [[novel]]s and sometimes other types of books (for example, biographies), a book may be divided into several large sections, also called books (Book 1, Book 2, Book 3, and so on). An avid reader of books is a [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] or colloquially, ''''bookworm''''.

A shop where [[Bookselling|books are bought and sold]] is a bookshop or bookstore. Books can also be borrowed from [[Lending library|libraries]]. [[Google]] has estimated that as of 2010, approximately 130,000,000 unique titles had been published.')

OBP is added to [[slugging average]] to determine [[on-base plus slugging]] (OPS). It first became an official [[MLB]] statistic in 1984.

==Overview==
Traditionally, players with the best on-base percentages bat as leadoff hitter. The league average for on-base percentage has varied considerably over time; in the modern era it is around .340, whereas it was typically only .300 in the [[dead-ball era]]. On-base percentage can also vary quite considerably from player to player. The record for the highest career OBP by a hitter, based on over 3000 [[plate appearance]]s, is .482 by [[Ted Williams]]. The lowest is by [[Bill Bergen]], who had an OBP of .194.

For small numbers of at-bats, it is possible (though unlikely) for a player''s on-base percentage to be lower than his [[batting average]] (H/AB). This happens when a player has almost no [[base on balls|walks]] or times [[hit by pitch]], with a higher number of [[sacrifice fly|sacrifice flies]] (e.g. if a player has 2 hits in 6 at bats plus a sacrifice fly, his batting average would be .333, but his on-base percentage would be .286).  The player who experienced this phenomenon with the most number of at-bats in a season was [[Ernie Bowman]], who over 125 at-bats in 1963 had a batting average of .184 and an on-base percentage of .181.

On-base percentage is calculated using this formula:

In [[baseball statistics]], a player is credited with a ''''''plate appearance'''''' (denoted by ''''''PA'''''') each time he completes a turn batting.  A player completes a turn batting when: he [[strikeout|strikes out]] or is declared [[out (baseball)|out]] before reaching first base; or he reaches first base [[safe (baseball)|safely]] or is awarded first base (by a [[base on balls]], [[hit by pitch]], or [[catcher''s interference]]); or he hits a [[fair ball]] which causes a preceding runner to be put out for the third out before he himself is put out or reaches first base safely (''''see also'''' [[left on base]], [[fielder''s choice]], [[force play]])

== Calculating ==
A batter is not charged with a plate appearance if, while he was [[at bat]], a preceding runner is put out on the basepaths for the third out in a way other than by the batter putting the ball into play (i.e., [[pickoff|picked off]], [[caught stealing]]). In this case, the same batter continues his turn batting in the next inning with no [[Balls and strikes (baseball)|balls]] or [[strike (baseball)|strikes]] against him.

A batter is not charged with a plate appearance if, while he was at bat, the game ends as the winning run scores from third base on a [[balk]].

A batter may or may not be charged with a plate appearance (and possibly at-bat) in the rare instance when he is replaced by a [[pinch hitter]] after having already started his turn at bat. In this case, the pinch hitter would receive the plate appearance (and potential of an at-bat) unless the original batter is replaced when having 2 strikes against him and the pinch hitter subsequently completes the strikeout.  In this case the plate appearance and at-bat are charged to the first batter. (see [http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp rule 10.15b])

In this clock, each column of LEDs shows a binary-coded decimal numeral of the traditional [[sexagesimal]] time.]]

In [[computing]] and [[electronics|electronic]] systems, ''''''binary-coded decimal'''''' (''''''BCD'''''') is a class of [[Binary numeral system|binary]] encodings of [[decimal]] numbers where each decimal [[numerical digit|digit]] is represented by a fixed number of [[bit]]s, usually four or eight, although other sizes (such as six bits) have been used historically. Special bit patterns are sometimes used for a [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] or for other indications (e.g., error or overflow). 

In byte-oriented systems (i.e. most modern computers), the term ''''uncompressed'''' BCD usually implies a full [[byte]] for each digit (often including a sign), whereas ''''packed'''' BCD typically encodes two decimal digits within a single byte by taking advantage of the fact that four bits are enough to represent the range 0 to 9. The precise 4-bit encoding may vary however, for technical reasons, see [[Excess-3]] for instance.

BCD''s main virtue is a more accurate representation and rounding of decimal quantities as well as an ease of conversion into human-readable representations. As compared to binary [[positional system]]s, BCD''s principal drawbacks are a small increase in the complexity of the circuits needed to implement basic arithmetics and a slightly less dense storage.

BCD was used in many early [[decimal computer]]s. Although BCD is not as widely used as in the past, decimal [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] and [[floating-point]] formats are still important and continue to be used in financial, commercial, and industrial computing, where subtle conversion and rounding errors that are inherent to floating point binary representations cannot be tolerated.')

== General comments ==
I''m not trying to be facetious, but what about celery?  That''s a taste that seems completely unique to me.  And so I guess one couldn''t argue that it''s a factor in other tastes, but now I''m curious as to what it is about celery that makes it taste the way it does.

Along the same lines, it would be nice if this article included something about wasabi/horseradish in the location about false heat.  It''s quite a different sensation from capsaicin. [[User:68.123.71.25|68.123.71.25]] 18:39, 11 June 2006 (UTC)lws

''''My understanding is that only the basic tastes are sensed with the taste buds.  Other tastes are really smells.  I''m no chemist, but I remember reading somewhere that some smells (like chocolate) are associated with a single chemical, while others (like strawberry) are quite complicated. -- [[User:Janet Davis|Janet Davis]]''''

In [[Major League Baseball]], the ''''''American League Division Series'''''' (''''''ALDS'''''') determines which two teams from the [[American League]] will advance to the [[American League Championship Series]]. The Division Series consists of two concurrent best-of-five series, featuring the three division winners and the winner  of  the [[wild card (sports)|wild-card]] game.

==History==
The Division Series was implemented in 1981 as a result of a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|midseason strike]], with the first place teams before the strike taking on the teams in first place after the strike.  After 1993, it was implemented for good when Major League Baseball restructured each league into three divisions, but their next playing was in 1995 due to the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|cancellation of the 1994 playoffs]].  In 1981, a split-season format forced the first ever divisional playoff series, in which the [[1981 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] won the Eastern Division series over the [[1981 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]] (who were in the American League until 1998) in five games while in the Western Division, the [[1981 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] swept the [[1981 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] (the only team with an overall losing record to ever make the postseason). The Yankees have currently played in the most division series in history, with fifteen appearances.  The [[Toronto Blue Jays]] are the only team to have never played in the ALDS and are the last team to win the World Series under the old 4 division format. The Kansas City Royals have yet to play in the ALDS since it became a postseason fixture in 1995.

===Determining the matchups===
From 1998 to 2011, the wild-card team has been assigned to play in  the division winner with the best winning percentage (outside of their own division) in one series, and the other two division winners meet in the other series. However, if the wild-card team and the division winner with the best record are from the same division, the wild-card team plays the division winner with the second-best record, and the remaining two division leaders play. Beginning with the 2012 season, the wild card team that advances to the Division Series will face the number 1 seed, regardless of whether or not they are in the same division. The two series winners move on to the best-of-seven ALCS.  Home field advantage goes to the team with the better regular season record, except for the wild card team, which never receives the home field advantage.

Beginning in 2007, MLB has implemented a new rule to give the team from the league that wins the All-Star Game with the best regular season record a slightly greater advantage.')

The team with the best overall record in the major leagues, the [[1981 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]], failed to win their division in either half of that season and were controversially excluded, as were the [[1981 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]], who finished with the NL''s second-best record.

''''''Bundle theory'''''', originated by the 18th century Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]], is the [[ontology|ontological]] theory about [[Object (philosophy)|objecthood]] in which an object consists only of a collection (''''bundle'''') of properties, relations or [[trope (philosophy)|tropes]].

According to bundle theory, an object consists of its properties and nothing more: thus neither can there be an object without properties nor can one even ''''conceive'''' of such an object; for example, bundle theory claims that thinking of an apple compels one also to think of its color, its shape, the fact that it is a kind of fruit, its cells, its taste, or at least one other of its properties.  Thus, the theory asserts that the apple is no more than the collection of its properties.  In particular, there is no ''''[[substance theory|substance]]'''' in which the properties ''''[[inherence|inhere]]''''.

==Arguments for the bundle theory==
The difficulty in conceiving of or describing an object without also conceiving of or describing its properties is a common justification for bundle theory, especially among current philosophers in the Anglo-American tradition.

The inability to comprehend any aspect of the thing other than its properties implies, this argument maintains, that one cannot conceive of a ''''bare particular'''' (a ''''substance'''' without properties), an implication that directly opposes [[substance theory]].  The conceptual difficulty of ''''bare particulars'''' was illustrated by [[John Locke]] when he described a ''''substance'''' by itself, apart from its properties, as')

A ''''''boat'''''' is a [[watercraft]] of any size designed to float or [[Planing (boat)|plane]], to provide [[boating|passage across water]]. Usually this water will be inland ([[lake]]s) or in protected coastal areas. However, boats such as the [[whaleboat]] were designed to be operated from a [[ship]] in an offshore environment. In [[Navy|naval]] terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard another vessel (a ship). Another less restrictive definition is a vessel that can be lifted out of the water.

''''''BASIC'''''' is a family of [[General-purpose programming language|general-purpose]], [[high-level programming language]]s whose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use; the name is an [[acronym]] from ''''''Beginner''s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code''''''.

The original [[Dartmouth BASIC]] was designed in 1964 by [[John George Kemeny]] and [[Thomas Eugene Kurtz]] at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[New Hampshire]], [[United States|USA]] to provide computer access to non-science students. At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom software, which was something only [[scientist]]s and [[mathematician]]s tended to do. The language and its variants became widespread on [[microcomputer]]s in the late 1970s and 1980s, when it was typically a standard feature, and often part of the [[firmware]] of the machine. The presence of an easy-to-learn language such as BASIC on these early [[personal computers]] allowed small business owners to develop their own custom application software, leading to widespread use of these computers')

In [[chaos theory]], the ''''''butterfly effect'''''' is the ''''sensitive dependence on initial conditions'''', where a small change at one place in a deterministic [[nonlinear system]] can result in large differences to a later state. The name of the effect, coined by [[Edward Lorenz]], is derived from the theoretical example of a hurricane''s formation being contingent on whether or not a distant butterfly had flapped its wings several weeks before.

Although the butterfly effect may appear to be an esoteric and unlikely behavior, it is exhibited by very simple systems: for example, a ball placed at the crest of a hill may roll into any of several valleys depending on, among other things, slight differences in initial position.

The butterfly effect is a common [[trope (literature)|trope]] in fiction when presenting scenarios involving [[time travel]] and with hypotheses where one storyline diverges at the moment of a seemingly minor event resulting in two significantly different outcomes.

==Origin of the concept and the term==

[[Chaos theory]] and the sensitive dependence on initial conditions was described in the literature in a particular case of the [[three-body problem]] by [[Henri Poincar')

A ''''''battleship'''''' is a large [[armour|armored]] [[warship]] with a main [[artillery battery|battery]] consisting of heavy [[caliber]] [[gun]]s. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the battleship was the most powerful type of warship, and a fleet of battleships was vital for any nation which desired to maintain [[command of the sea]]. During [[World War II]], [[aircraft carrier]]s overtook battleships in power. Some battleships remained in service during the [[Cold War]] and the last were decommissioned in the 1990s.

The word ''''battleship'''' was coined around 1794 and is a contraction of the phrase ''''[[ship of the line|line-of-battle ship]],'''' the dominant wooden warship during the [[Age of Sail]].')

A ''''''battlecruiser'''''', or ''''''battle cruiser'''''', was a large [[capital ship]] built in the first half of the 20th century. They were similar in size and cost to a [[battleship]], and typically carried the same kind of heavy guns, but battlecruisers generally carried less armour and were faster.

The first battlecruisers were developed in the [[United Kingdom]] in the first decade of the century, as a development of the [[armoured cruiser]], at the same time the [[dreadnought]] succeeded the [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]. The original aim of the battlecruiser was to hunt down slower, older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire. However, as more and more battlecruisers were built, they increasingly became used alongside the better-protected battleships.

Battlecruisers served in the navies of [[Royal Navy|Britain]], [[German Imperial Navy|Germany]], [[Royal Australian Navy|Australia]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japan]] during World War I, most notably at the  [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] and in the several raids and skirmishes in the North Sea which culminated in a pitched fleet battle, the [[Battle of Jutland]]. British battlecruisers in particular suffered heavy losses at Jutland, where their light armour made them very vulnerable to battleship shells.

By the end of the war, capital ship design had developed with battleships becoming faster and battlecruisers becoming more and more heavily armoured, blurring the distinction between a battlecruiser and a [[fast battleship]]. The [[Washington Naval Treaty]], which limited capital ship')

Hello!  I would like to exchange links with you, if that''s possible.  Wikipedia and Nupedia are free, open content encyclopedias.  Wikipedia now has about 10,000 articles, including many in the life sciences, and Nupedia''s (peer reviewed) biology category is its most active.

Wikipedia would be happy to include a link to the Encyclopedia of Life Sciences on our')
INSERT INTO articles (title, created_at, updated_at, body) values ('Wikipedia:Building Wikipedia membership/Another sample solicitation', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '{{historical}}

I am only now starting to publicize Wikipedia, a wiki-based free (open
content) encyclopedia project.  We started last January and already have
about 10,000 articles.  Perhaps you have seen us by now--we''re located at
http://www.wikipedia.com . I''m the person responsible for organizing and
leading Wikipedia, as well as Nupedia (which has been moving *much* more
slowly).

First things first: it would be fantastic if you would like to link to any
or all of our articles.  They''re free, of course.  I''d like to make this
as easy as possible for you, if you''re interested.

If you have any free articles we can use, I would like to know about it!

More interestingly, perhaps, for you, is the idea that you can actually
use our content as part of your website.  It''s free.  The cream of the
crop can be found at http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki.cgi?Brilliant_prose ,
but there''s a *lot* more than that.  Also, the quality of Nupedia articles
is guaranteed; see http://www.nupedia.com/newest.phtml .  (There just
isn''t much there yet.)

One thing we''re working on is a program that will make it extremely easy
to mirror Wikipedia''s content.  We''re not done with that yet--but is that
something you might be interested in?

I certainly would like to hear back from you about how we might be able to
support each other.  I do not regard your website as a competitor in any
sense at all.

What happened to AMBROSE CHAPEL? That would have been a logical choice for De Palma to have made into a movie. It would have restored De Palma to critical and box-office glory after his most popular film MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE, if not one of his most disappointing films from an appalling script with so many plot-holes. Such skilled direction by De Palma with MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE would have made a definitive film out of AMBROSE CHAPEL if all the elements of production came together! AMBROSE CHAPEL and THE DEMOLISHED MAN are the two films I''ve always wanted to see De Palma direct. I hope THE DEMOLISHED MAN and AMBROSE CHAPEL have not been lost forever. With the sucess of INCEPTION one would think these two films were no-brainers for someone like De Palma. AMBROSE CHAPEL and THE DEMOLISHED MAN would have been more successful then MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE at the world-wide box-office instead De Palma is to direct a french remake of female corporate murder that doesn''t sound so promosing. I hate the people in the Hollywood studio system who decide what gets made and not and who directs. AMBROSE CHAPEL and THE DEMOLISHED MAN should get green-lit immediatly. Hopefully with De Palma, Oliver Stone or Christopher Nolan!!!!!HARRY GEORGATOS 

==Untitled==
HARRY GEORGATOS:Doesn''t De Palma have final cut in his movies? According to a website Hollywood bigwigs treat De Palma with contempt. His films have generated little box-office buisness with only a small handful making respectable takings. MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE and THE UNTOUCHABLES have been his most successful. SNAKE EYES and MISSION TO MARS did some minor buisness. SNAKE EYES and MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE seem like severely compromised films. MISSION needed more real sweat and violence. The scene where Ethan has the black hood removed to finally meet Max was building to an explosive piece of gun violence. When there was no extensive gun battle it seemed like the film was desperatly missing something. The way Max Von Sydow CIA assassin crew eliminated Robert Redfords bookworms in THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR was a scene that should have been applied at that moment in MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE. SNAKE EYES would have to have the worse ending in Hollywood history! There was an extensive CGI set-piece removed from the film by the brutal force of the studio to that appalling ending. De Palma had a more violent version with a higher sex quotient in his original cut. The studio forced him to change the film and thus damage the movie. It''s like telling Scorsese, Spielberg or the Coen brothers to water down the violence in films like THE DEPARTED, MUNICH or NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. If anyone has a bootleg director''s copy of De Palma''s original cut of SNAKE EYES contact me harry.georgatos@yahoo.com.au, and will pay good money! Organic violence is what one expects in a De Palma film. SNAKE EYES and MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE should have been a volatile cocktail of secret spy violence. Tarantino''s INGLORIOUS BASTERDS was a violent piece of mayhem and has become Tarantino''s most successful film alongside PULP FICTION. Why shouldn''t De Palma be given the same freedom then some compromised film as a result of market research test screenings which have destroyed so many films in Hollywood. De Palma has been unable to make a great film since CARLITO''S WAY. FEMME FATALE was brilliantly directed with appalling performances from the two leads. De Palma''s great films started with SISTERS, OBSESSION, CARRIE, THE FURY, DRESSED TO KILL, BLOW OUT, SCARFACE, THE UNTOUCHABLES, CASUALTIES OF WAR and his last great film CARLITO''S WAY.

== External References Order of Preference ==


External Reference #80 on the Bipolar Disorder page previously went to a freely available copy of the full text of the referenced 1999 medical study.  It has been replaced with a reference to a medical information subscription service.  Discussions about Wiki external references policies have been split down the middle with two physicians arguing that it is not necessary to provide a reference to freely available copies of the study and two end users arguing that a Wiki policy favoring subscription service references over freely available material obsoletes the value and credibility of Wiki. One solution would be for Wiki to clarify external linking policies by outlining an order of preference (if there is one) when paid vs unpaid choices exist.

A ''''''broadcast domain'''''' is a logical division of a [[computer network]], in which all [[node (networking)|node]]s can reach each other by [[broadcasting (computing)|broadcast]] at the [[data link layer]]. A broadcast domain can be within the same LAN segment or it can be bridged to other LAN segments.

In terms of current popular technologies: Any computer connected to the same [[Ethernet]] [[repeater]] or [[network switch|switch]] is a member of the same broadcast domain. Further, any computer connected to the same set of inter-connected switches/repeaters is a member of the same broadcast domain. [[Router (computing)|Router]]s and other [[Network layer|higher-layer]] devices form boundaries between broadcast domains.

This is as compared to a [[collision domain]], which would be all nodes on the same set of inter-connected repeaters, divided by switches and learning bridges. Collision domains are generally smaller than, and contained within, broadcast domains.

While some [[Data Link Layer|layer two network]] devices are able to divide the collision domains, broadcast domains are only divided by layer 3 network devices such as routers or layer 3 switches. Separating [[virtual LAN|VLANs]] divides broadcast domains as well, but provides no means to network these without layer 3 functionality.

== Further explanation ==

The distinction between broadcast and collision domains comes about because simple [[Ethernet]] and similar systems use a shared [[transmission system]]. In simple Ethernet (without switches or [[network bridge|bridges]]), [[data frame]]s are transmitted to all other nodes on a network. Each receiving node checks the destination address of each frame, and simply ignores any frame not addressed to its own MAC.

Switches act as buffers, receiving and analyzing the frames from each connected network segment. Frames destined for nodes connected to the originating segment are not forwarded by the switch. Frames destined for a specific node on a different segment are sent only to that segment. Only broadcast frames are forwarded to all other segments. This reduces unnecessary traffic and collisions.

In such a switched network, transmitted frames may not be received by all other reachable nodes. Nominally, only broadcast frames will be received by all other nodes. Collisions are localized to the network segment they occur on. Thus, the broadcast domain is the entire inter-connected [[Data Link Layer|layer two network]], and the segments connected to each switch/bridge port are each a collision domain.

Not all network systems or media feature broadcast/collision domains. For example, [[Point-to-Point Protocol|PPP links]].

==Broadcast domain control==

With a sufficiently sophisticated switch, it is possible to create a network in which the normal notion of a broadcast domain is strictly controlled. One implementation of this concept is termed a')

Dictated by specific [[hydrogen bonding]] patterns, Watson-Crick base pairs ([[guanine]]-[[cytosine]] and [[adenine]]-[[thymine]]) allow the DNA helix to maintain a regular helical structure that is independent of its [[nucleotide sequence]]. The [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] nature of this based-paired structure provides a backup copy of all [[genetic information]] encoded within double-stranded DNA. The regular structure and data redundancy provided by the DNA double helix make DNA well suited to the storage of genetic information, while base-pairing between DNA and incoming nucleotides provide the mechanism through which [[DNA polymerase]] replicates DNA, and [[RNA polymerase]] transcribes DNA into RNA. Many DNA-binding proteins can recognize specific base pairing patterns that identify particular regulatory regions of genes.

Intramolecular base pairs can occur within single-stranded nucleic acids. This is particularly important in RNA molecules (e.g. [[transfer RNA]]), where Watson-Crick base pairs (G-C and A-U) permit the formation of short double-stranded helices, and a wide variety of non-Watson-Crick interactions (e.g. G-U or A-A) allow RNAs to fold into a vast range of specific three-dimensional [[RNA structure|structures]]. In addition, base-paring between transfer RNA (tRNA) and [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) forms the basis for the [[molecular recognition]] events that result in the nucleotide sequence of mRNA becoming [[Genetic code|translated]] into the amino acid sequence of [[proteins]].

The size of an individual [[gene]] or an organism''s entire [[genome]] is often measured in base pairs because DNA is usually double-stranded. Hence, the number of total base pairs is equal to the number of nucleotides in one of the strands (with the exception of non-coding single-stranded regions of [[telomere]]s).

The ''''''Book of Daniel'''''' is one of the books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the Christian [[Old Testament]]. It is notable for its changes from [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] to [[Biblical Aramaic|Aramaic]] and back. The first part of the book, comprising six chapters, is the story of [[Daniel]] set in the courts of [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]] and [[Achaemenid Empire]] during the time of the [[Babylonian captivity]]. The remainder of the book contain three [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] and their interpretation.

There is sharp difference between the [[fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] view of Daniel and the [[scholarly consensus]]. Conservative Biblical scholars and evangelical commentators hold that its stories tell of real events and real [[prophecy|prophecies]] written during and shortly after the [[Babylonian captivity]] by a real [[Daniel]] living in the late sixth century BCE. The scholarly consensus is that the Book of Daniel (or at least the last three chapters) was written after [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] desecrated the altar of the Temple of Jerusalem around 167 BCE. In this view, Daniel was written in reaction to that incident and the final [[redaction]] of the work dates to the second century BCE. For secular scholars, the issue was settled over a century ago,{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=2}} but many Christians do not accept this line of reasoning, looking to [[Jesus]]'' implicit approval of the book by quoting from it in his teachings.

Constantinople fell to the Turkish Ottoman Empire in 1453. The name of the city was changed to Istanbul in 1930 following the establishment of modern Turkey.

This is a wrong statement. How is it that the city of Constantinople stayed until 1930? What was it called till 1930 if it fell in 1453?')

[[File:Boomerang.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A typical wooden returning boomerang]]
A ''''''boomerang'''''' is a thrown tool, typically constructed as a flat aerofoil, that is designed to spin about an axis perpendicular to the direction of its flight.

A returning boomerang is designed to circle back to the thrower. 

Boomerangs have been historically used for hunting, as well as sport, and entertainment. They are commonly thought of as an Australian icon.

== Description ==
A boomerang is usually thought of as a wooden device cut from a tree trunk, although historically boomerang-like devices have also been made from bones. Modern boomerangs used for sport are often made from thin aircraft plywood, plastics such as [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]], [[polypropylene]], [[phenolic paper]], or even high-tech materials such as [[Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre-reinforced plastics]]. Boomerangs come in many shapes and sizes depending on their geographic or tribal origins and intended function. Many people think of a boomerang as the Australian type, although today there are many types of easier to use boomerangs, such as the cross-stick; the pinwheel; the tumblestick; the boomabird; and many other less common types.

An important distinction should be made between returning boomerangs and non-returning boomerangs. Returning boomerangs fly and are examples of the earliest heavier-than-air man-made flight. A returning boomerang has two or more [[airfoil]] wings arranged so that the spinning creates unbalanced [[aerodynamic]] forces that curve its path so that it travels in an [[Ellipse|elliptical]] path and returns to its point of origin when thrown correctly. While a [[throwing stick]] can also be shaped overall like a returning boomerang, it is designed to travel as straight as possible so that it can be aimed and thrown with great force to bring down game. Its surfaces therefore are symmetrical and not uneven like the aerofoils which give the returning boomerang its characteristic curved flight.

The most recognisable type of boomerang is the returning boomerang; while non-returning boomerangs, [[throwing stick]]s (or shaunies) were used as weapons, returning boomerangs have been used primarily for leisure or recreation. Returning boomerangs were also used as decoy birds of prey, thrown above long grass to frighten [[game (food)|game]] birds into flight and into waiting nets. Modern returning boomerangs can be of various shapes or sizes as can be seen in a photo in the ''''[[#Modern use|Modern use]]'''' section.

Historical evidence also points to the use of non-returning boomerangs by the ancient [[Egyptians]], Native Americans of California and [[Arizona]], and inhabit')

This is a special case of violation of [[memory safety]].

Buffer overflows can be triggered by inputs that are designed to execute code, or alter the way the program operates. This may result in erratic program behavior, including memory access errors, incorrect results, a [[crash (computing)|crash]], or a breach of system security. Thus, they are the basis of many [[vulnerability (computer science)|software vulnerabilities]] and can be maliciously [[exploit (computer security)|exploited]].

[[Programming language]]s commonly associated with buffer overflows include [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], which provide no built-in protection against accessing or overwriting data in any part of memory and do not automatically check that data written to an array (the built-in buffer type) is within the boundaries of that array. [[Bounds checking]] can prevent buffer overflows.

==Technical description==
A buffer overflow occurs when [[data]] written to a buffer also corrupts data values in [[memory address]]es adjacent to the destination buffer due to insufficient [[bounds checking]]. This can occur when copying data from one buffer to another without first checking that the data fits within the destination buffer.

===Example===
In the following example, a program has two data items which are adjacent in memory: an 8-byte-long string buffer, A, and a two-byte [[endianness|big-endian]] integer, B.')

According to the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC):
{{quote|A ''''bioterrorism attack'''' 

is the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria, toxins or other harmful agents used to cause illness or death in people, animals, or plants. These agents are typically found in nature, but it is possible that they could be mutated or altered to increase their ability to cause disease, make them resistant to current medicines, or to increase their ability to be spread into the environment. Biological agents can be spread through the air, water, or in food. Terrorists tend to use biological agents because they are extremely difficult to detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days. Some bioterrorism agents, like the smallpox virus, can be spread from person to person and some, like anthrax, cannot.')

It involves using [[autologous]] tissue or [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] material to construct a natural-looking breast. Often this includes the reformation of a natural-looking [[areola]] and [[nipple]]. This procedure involves the use of [[breast implant|implants]] or relocated flaps of the patient''s own tissue.

==Overview==
The primary part of the procedure can often be carried out immediately following the mastectomy. As with many other surgeries, patients with significant medical comorbidities ([[high blood pressure]], [[obesity]], [[diabetes]]) and [[Tobacco smoking|smokers]] are higher-risk candidates. Surgeons may choose to perform delayed reconstruction to decrease this risk. The infection rate may be higher with primary reconstruction (done at the same time as mastectomy), but there are psychologic and financial benefits to having a single primary reconstruction.  Patients expected to receive external beam radiation as part of their adjuvant treatment are also commonly considered for delayed autologous reconstruction due to significantly higher complication rates with tissue expander-implant techniques in those patients.

Breast reconstruction is a large undertaking that usually takes multiple operations. Sometimes these follow-up surgeries are spread out over weeks or months. If an implant is used, the individual runs the same risks and complications as those who use them for [[breast augmentation]] but has higher rates of [[capsular contracture]] (tightening or hardening of the scar tissue around the implant) and revisional surgeries.

I had added a list of rulers in Brandenburg in Germania from the time after Charlemagne till 1134 Albert I of Brandenburg (Albrecht the Baer).

Someone erased the list of more than 100 office holders ,writing something about German apologists.

As it now states in the article , it seems that Slavs came , took over and only Slavs lived there till 1134, when Albrecht the Baer
brought in Germans. This has been a popular theory by English speakers for many years.

It is false .

Does anyone have an explatation, why this widespread theory with English speakers exists ?

It existed from about 1983 at least into the 2000s.

The [[cabal]] was created in an effort to facilitate reliable propagation of new Usenet posts:  While in the 1970s and 1980s many news servers only operated during night time to save on the cost of long distance communication, servers of the backbone cabal were available 24 hours a day. The administrators of these servers gained sufficient influence in the otherwise anarchic Usenet community to be able to push through controversial changes, for instance the [[Great Renaming]] of [[Usenet]] newsgroups during the 1980s.

== History ==
As Usenet has few technologically or legally enforced hierarchies, just about the only ones that formed were [[social hierarchy|social hierarchies]]. People acquired power through persuasion, exerted both publicly and privately, public debate, force of will (often via aggressive [[flaming (internet)|flames]]), garnering authority and respect by spending much time and effort contributing to the community (by being a maintainer of a [[FAQ]], for example; see also [[James Parry|Kibo]], etc.).

== Miscellaneous ==
We definitely need to come up with a better classification here, at some point.  It''s a good start, but games like [[:Abalone|Abalone]] and [[:Die Siedler von Catan|Die Siedler]] really defy any coarse classification.  Perhaps nested classification pages, with games existing on multiple pages?  I''m planning on adding entries for a few more games that we play regularly, most of rticle. The same could apply to any other specialist categorization.  --[[User:Imran|Imran]]

My preference, therefore, is to do the best we can to avoid listing any game twice.  No classification system will be perfect, but a unified system is much to be desired, even if there is more than one principle on which it _could_ be based.

Oh, and as to Risk, I forgot that it has evolved from being a pure elimination game as it was when I first learned it.  But it still belongs in the elimination category, because players can be wiped out even when assignment cards are used, and then they may have nothing to do until the next game starts.  I will modify the description to include possible elimination.

''''''''''Basic Role-Playing'''''''''' (''''''''''BRP'''''''''') is a [[role-playing game system]] which originated in the [[fantasy]]-oriented ''''[[RuneQuest]]'''' [[role-playing game]] rules. A percentile skill-based system, ''''BRP'''' was used as the basis for most of the games published by [[Chaosium]], including ''''[[Stormbringer (role-playing game)|Stormbringer]]'''', ''''[[Worlds of Wonder (game)|Worlds of Wonder]]'''', ''''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'''', ''''[[Superworld]]'''', ''''[[Ringworld (RPG)|Ringworld]]'''', ''''[[Elfquest]]'''', ''''[[Hawkmoon]]'''', ''''Elric!'''', and ''''[[Nephilim (RPG)|Nephilim]]''''. ''''[[Pendragon (role-playing game)|Pendragon]]'''' (acquired in 1998 by [[Green Knight Publishing]], and 2005 by White Wolf), while related, has sufficiently different mechanics that it can be seen as a separate system. The ''''BRP'''' standalone booklet was first released in [[1980 in games|1980]]. Two years later it became part of the ''''[[Worlds of Wonder (game)|Worlds of Wonder]]'''' boxed set. The first edition boxed set of ''''Call of Cthulhu'''' included the booklet as its character creation rules. [[Greg Stafford]] and [[Lynn Willis]] are credited as the authors.

''''BRP'''' is similar to other generic systems such as ''''[[GURPS]]'''', ''''[[Hero System]]'''' or ''''[[Savage Worlds]]'''' in that it uses a simple resolution method which can be broadly applied, in this case an attempt to roll under a certain number with percentile dice.

In [[cryptography]], a ''''''block cipher'''''' is a [[deterministic algorithm]] operating on fixed-length groups of [[bit]]s, called ''''blocks'''', with an unvarying transformation that is specified by a [[symmetric key]]. Block ciphers are important [[cryptographic primitive|elementary component]]s in the design of many [[cryptographic protocol]]s, and are widely used to implement [[encryption]] of bulk data.

The modern design of block ciphers is based on the concept of an ''''iterated'''' [[product cipher]]. Product ciphers were suggested and analyzed by [[Claude Shannon]] in his seminal 1949 publication ''''[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]'''' as a means to effectively improve security by combining simple operations such as [[substitution cipher|substitution]]s and [[transposition cipher|permutation]]s.')

The ''''''Booch method'''''' is a technique used in [[software engineering]]. It is an [[object modeling language]] and methodology that was widely used in [[object-oriented analysis and design]]. It was developed by [[Grady Booch]], while at [[Rational Software]] (now part of [[IBM]]).

The notation aspect of the Booch method has now been superseded by the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), which features graphical elements from the Booch method along with elements from the [[object-modeling technique]] (OMT) and [[object-oriented software engineering]] (OOSE).

Methodological aspects of the Booch method have been incorporated into several methodologies and processes, the primary such methodology being the [[Rational Unified Process]] (RUP).

The Booch design methodology is like OMT extensively used has ample documentation and support tools.

''''''Baron Aberdare'''''', of Duffryn in the [[Glamorgan|County of Glamorgan]], is a title in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. It was created on 23 August 1873 for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician [[Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare|Henry Bruce]]. He served as [[Home Secretary]] from 1868 to 1873. His grandson, the third Baron, was a soldier, cricketer and tennis player and a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]]. His son, the fourth Baron, held office in the [[Conservative Government 1970-1974|Conservative administration]] of [[Edward Heath]] and was later a Deputy Speaker of the [[House of Lords]]. Lord Aberdare was one of the ninety-two elected [[hereditary peer]]s that were allowed to remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the [[House of Lords Act 1999]]. {{As of|2010}} the title is held by his son, the fifth Baron, who succeeded in 2005 and was elected to the House of Lords in 2009.

==Earlier comments==
Boxing Day is the first weekday after Christmas Day.It also a day for loads of people to get naked and have sex with each other :D. This is substantiated in numerous documents, and in perfectly clear language in both the Oxford English Dictionary and also the Merriam Webster Dictionary (the most recent versions of each, and naturally in preceeding versions.) So, referring to several of the comments below, then Boxing Day is not on a fixed date.

''''''Balsall Heath'''''' is a working class, [[inner-city]] area of [[Birmingham]], West Midlands, England. It is home to a diverse cultural mix of people and the location of the [[Balti Triangle]].

[[File:Balsall Heath Baths and Library.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Public Library and Baths, Balsall Heath|Balsall Heath Baths and Library]].]]
Balsall Heath was agricultural land between [[Moseley]] village and the city of Birmingham until the 1850s when expansion along Moseley Road joined the two. The area was originally part of the [[Worcestershire]] parish of [[King''s Norton]], and was added to the [[county borough]] of Birmingham in [[Warwickshire]] on 1 October 1891.

During negotiations in the previous year it had been promised a public baths and a free library. In 1895 the library was opened on Moseley Road and in 1907 [[Public Library and Baths, Balsall Heath|Balsall Heath Baths]] were opened in an adjoining building.  

In 1900 the city''s [[College of Art, Balsall Heath|College of Art]] was also opened on Moseley Road. By this time the small lake (''''Lady Pool'''' on old maps) at the end of Ladypool Road had been filled-in to create a park. 

Balsall Heath initially had a reasonably affluent population, which can still be seen in the dilapidated grandeur of some of the larger houses. A railway station on Brighton Road (on the Birmingham to [[Bristol]] line) led to further expansion, and the end of the 19th century saw a proliferation of high-density small [[terraced house]]s.

A [[Muslim]] community was started in June 1940 when two [[Yemen]]is purchased an artisan cottage on Mary Street. They went on to establish the first mosque in the city. With the mosque being located in the area, more Muslim immigrants began to move into private lodgings in Balsall Heath.')

== Reorganization ==
I have reorganized the list as to who''s list is older. That is: Tanakh, a table listing a difference between the Prod/Cath OTs, the apocrypha, and the NT. -- [[User:Hoshie|iHoshie]] 08:35, 25 Jan 2004 (UTC)

: The current list appears to have dropped the deuterocanonical books of the Septuagint not kept by the Roman Catholics but retained by the Orthodox that were listed as groups B., C., and D. above. I noticed when I tried to find 3rd and 4th Maccabees. Did they just get missed in the reorganization? [[User:Wesley|Wesley]] 05:07, 30 May 2004 (UTC)

: I just added an Orthodox column to the end, because that was easiest. It still has a couple of omissions, and one or two more footnotes wouldn''t hurt. The Orthodox Bible has a Psalm 151, and a few more verses at the end of Job telling who he is and how he''s related to Abraham, for instance. [[User:Wesley|Wesley]] \

: To keep the columns ordered by age, I believe the Protestant column would come last; not sure how the Catholic and Orthodox columns would be sequenced, probably matters far less in that case. [[User:Wesley|Wesley]] 16:55, 29 Jun 2004 (UTC)

== WikiProject ==
Based on a suggestion in [[Wikipedia:Pages needing attention]], I have started the skeleton of a [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Bible|WikiProject]] to try to cut down on the overlap between the various presentations of the canon. I think that a lot of people working here will want input on this. Feel free! [[User:Mpolo|Mpolo]] 13:24, Sep 14, 2004 (UTC)

== Location Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekhiel ==
Why aren''t the three books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekhiel in the Tanakh at the same level with the corresponding three books in the Christian Bibles in the table? Thanks. (Bronto)

Same question. Also, if the intention is to list the books in the order used in the holy book in question, shouldn''t that be mentioned in the description? [[User:Aliter|Aliter]] 16:03, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)

==Title==
Should [[Revelation]] be labeled as ''''The Prophecy'''' or just ''''Prophecy'''', or some other name such as ''''Apocalyptic Literature'''' or ''''Prophetic Literature''''...surely some terms similar to the latter ones have wide currency in academic Biblical scholarship. --[[User:Dpr|Dpr]] 03:45, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

INSERT INTO articles (title, created_at, updated_at, body) values ('Boolean satisfiability problem', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '{{Redirect|3SAT|the Central European television network|3sat}}
In [[computer science]], ''''''satisfiability'''''' (often written in all capitals or abbreviated ''''''SAT'''''') is the problem of determining if there exists an [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]], which [[Satisfiability|satisfies]] the [[Formula (mathematical logic)|formula]]. In other words, it establishes if the variables of a given [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] formula can be assigned in such a way as to make the formula [[Validity|evaluate to TRUE]]. Equally important is to determine whether no such assignments exist, which would imply that the function expressed by the formula is [[Contradiction#Contradiction_in_formal_logic|identically FALSE]] for all possible variable assignments. In this latter case, we would say that the function is unsatisfiable; otherwise it is satisfiable. For example, the formula ''''a'''' AND ''''b'''' is satisfiable because one can find the values ''''a''''')

==introductory comments==

While I don''t disagree with any of the facts presented, shouldn''t this article say a bit more about the university? If the only goal is to criticize it, then you could mention that they have also been criticized for denying that Catholics and Mormons are Christians. Personally, I think it would be much more helpful for Wikipedia to include some basic information like when the school was founded, whether they offer postgraduate degrees, which academic programs or sports teams are strongest, and so on. And who the heck is Bob Jones? If someone comes to Wikipedia to learn about Bob Jones University, it''s probably because they already heard it was racist and want to learn more background information. And if a prospective college student is wanting to learn more about the university from third party sources, it''s fine to point out its racism, but we can serve those people better by also providing more factual background information. And no, I''m not volunteering to do the actual research for this one. ;-)  --[[User:Wesley|Wesley]]

:Agreed, but, again, my interest in finding out more about an institution (one struggles to accept it as a university, with such an illogical attitude) with such ridiculous rules is about zero.  

Oh, well - other than the dates, I added what *I* care about, which is the Museum.  I can''t tell you how odd it is to find a museum like this in Greenville, SC.  --MichaelTinkler

''''''Behavior'''''' or ''''''behaviour'''''' is the range of actions and mannerisms made by [[organism]]s, [[systems]], or [[Artificial Intelligence|artificial entities]] in conjunction with their environment, which includes the other systems or organisms around as well as the physical environment.

In humans, behavior is believed to be controlled primarily by the [[endocrine system]] and the [[nervous system]]. It is most commonly believed that complexity in the behavior of an organism is correlated to the complexity of its nervous system. Generally, organisms with more complex nervous systems have a greater capacity to [[learn]] new responses and thus adjust their behavior.

Behaviors can be either [[innate]] or learned. 

Behavior can be regarded as any action of an organism that changes its relationship to its environment. Behavior provides outputs from the organism to the environment.')

==Historicist Interpretation==
Seems to be indicating that it is marginal and accepted only by Fundamentalist Christians--and that there are possible echoes of this in antiquity (but nothing concrete). This is clearly the longest held position throughout the history of the discussion--go back just three hundred years and it was virtually the only position held in New England.--[[User:Eleuthero|eleuthero]] 03:58, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

While the information may be accurate, is it really necessary to note, as this section does, that an apocalyptic end of the world has not yet occurred?  The statement seems to serve no purpose other than to ridicule religious movements that have falsely predicted past dates as dates of Revelation.

''''''Blood alcohol content'''''' (''''''BAC''''''), also called ''''''blood alcohol concentration'''''', ''''''blood ethanol concentration'''''', or ''''''blood alcohol level'''''' is most commonly used as a metric of [[alcohol intoxication]] for legal or medical purposes.

Blood alcohol content is usually expressed as a [[percentage]] of [[alcohol]] (generally in the sense of [[ethanol]]) in the [[blood]]. For instance, a BAC of 0.10 means that 0.10% (one tenth of one percent) of a person''s blood, by volume (usually, but in some countries by mass), is alcohol.

== A good idea ==
Would it be a good idea to include information about the quantum mechanical concept of black box (often refered to as black body) radiation? 

''''Black boxes are designed to specifications. The specification defines the inputs and outputs. It also defines the tools to replace the unit (usually nothing more than a #2 Phillips-head screwdriver), and the bulk and weight (they always need to be carried by one man, and fit through a door, if possible).''''

So philosphers are coming up with abstract theories about the mind as an object that can be removed using a screwdriver and is small enough to be carried by one man.  No wonder philosophy doesn''t pay much - I could have told you that!  Though I''d use a scalpel and a drill myself.  [[User:Verloren|Verloren]]

This article could do with refactoring:
* it doesn''t say what a BB actually does on a ship / plane (I know of Black Box recorders on planes, but I infer from the article that there are other types)
* which came first, the philosophy BB or the technological BB?
* maybe seperate out the two concepts, starting with the earlier use of the term. -- [[user:Tarquin|Tarquin]]


:Seems like a very avionic slant to me.  I suggest Black Box flight recorders, the game, and phone phreaking should be different articles.  That leaves some fungus proof, easily removable with a #2 phillips-head philosophies to deal with. - [[user:MichaelHiggins|MichaelHiggins]]


== To split ==
I wanted to split this up into a couple of articles and a disambig, but I couldn''t figure out whether or not the first section talks about the same thing as the second section. -[[User:Smack|Smack]] 04:08 5 Jul 2003 (UTC)


== Modification ==
I modified the definition because I felt the previous definition was too narrow.  I''m basing my definition on the way that the term was used in my electrical engineer')

The dance was described as early as 1805 by Mameli and by [[Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora|La Marmora]] in 1825. In northern and central Sardinia, the dance is lively and animated with leaps and agile movements and usually accompanied by a choir of three or more singers in the center of the circle. In other areas, the dance is done to ''''[[launeddas]]'''' and the shepherd''s ''''sulittu'''' but the accordion had also made its appearance by the 19th century.

I don''t agree with the shift of Cleveland Browns content to the [[:Cleveland Browns|Cleveland Browns]] page.  The old Browns and current Ravens are linearly the same franchise, with the same owner and carrying over much of the same management structure and player personnel.  The new Browns are an expansion team with new owners and personnel.  As is correctly pointed out, the current franchise owns the old trademarks and stuff, but that''s not relevant; it''s like saying that Michael Jackson was a Beatle because he now owns the rights to the old Lennon-McCartney songs.  

Willing to be persuaded; otherwise, would recommend switching it back.  -- [[User:RjLesch|RjLesch]]

I am inclined to agree.  While it is true that the NFL decided to transfer the teams history, the fact remains that the Baltimore Ravens were not an expansion team.  They had the same players, coaches, and management as the old Browns, and it is they new Browns that are the true expansion team. [[User:Jeff8765|Jeff8765]] 15:42, Jan 24, 2005 (UTC)

*But currently, the NFL and all its official records technically treats the Baltimore Ravens as an 1996 ''''''expansion team'''''' who just got same players, coaches, and management as the old Browns.

The ''''''politics of Canada'''''' function within a framework of [[parliamentary democracy]] and a [[federation|federal system]] of [[Parliament of Canada|parliamentary government]] with strong democratic traditions. [[Canada]] is a [[constitutional monarchy]], in which the [[Monarchy of Canada|Monarch]] is [[head of state]]. The country has a [[multi-party system]] in which many of its legislative practices derive from the unwritten [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] of and precedents set by Great Britain''s [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster Parliament]]. However, Canada has evolved variations: party discipline in Canada is stronger than in the United Kingdom and more parliamentary votes are considered [[Motion of Confidence|motions of confidence]], which tends to diminish the role of [[Cabinet (government)|non-Cabinet]] Members of Parliament (MPs). Such members, in the government [[caucus]], and junior or lower-profile members of [[parliamentary opposition|opposition]] caucuses, are known as [[backbencher]]s. Backbenchers can, however, exert their influence by sitting in parliamentary committees, like the Public Accounts Committee or the National Defence Committee. The two dominant political parties in Canada have historically been the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] and [[Conservative Party of Canada]] (or its [[Conservative_Party_of_Canada#Predecessors|predecessors]]), however, as of the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 election]] the social-democratic [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) has risen to prominence. This rise of prominence mirrors a historic decline in the Liberal party''s popularity. Smaller parties like the Quebec nationalist [[Bloc Qu')

''''''Computer software'''''', or just ''''''software'''''', is any set of machine-readable instructions (most often in the form of a [[computer program]]) that directs a computer''s [[computer processor|processor]] to perform specific operations. The term is used to contrast with [[computer hardware]], the physical objects ([[computer processor|processor]] and related devices) that carry out the instructions. Hardware and software require each other; neither has any value without the other.

[[Firmware]] is software that has been permanently stored in hardware (specifically in [[non-volatile memory]]). It thus has qualities of both software and hardware.

Software is a general term. It can refer to all computer instructions in general or to any specific set of computer instructions. It is inclusive of both [[machine code|machine instructions]] (the [[binary code]] that the processor understands) and [[source code]] (more human-understandable instructions that must be rendered into machine code by [[compiler]]s or [[interpreter]]s before being executed).

On most computer platforms, software can be grouped into a few broad categories:
* [[System software]] is the basic software needed for a computer to operate (most notably the [[operating system]]).
* [[Application software]] is all the software that uses the computer system to perform useful work beyond the operation of the computer itself.
* [[Embedded software]] resides as firmware within [[embedded systems]], devices dedicated to a single use. In that context there is no clear distinction between the system and application software.

Software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer. In other words, software is a set of ''''programs, procedures, algorithms'''' and its ''''documentation'''' concerned with the operation of a data processing system. Program software performs the [[Function (engineering)|function]] of the [[Computer program|program]] it implements, either by directly providing [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] to the [[digital electronics]] or by serving as input to another piece of software. The [[Terminology|term]] was coined to contrast to the term ''''hardware'''' (meaning physical devices). In contrast to hardware, software')

The people of [[Chad]] speak more than 100 different languages and divide themselves into many ethnic groups. However, language and ethnicity are not the same. Moreover, neither element can be tied to a particular physical type.

Although the possession of a common language shows that its speakers have lived together and have a common history, peoples also change languages. This is particularly so in Chad, where the openness of the terrain, marginal rainfall, frequent drought and famine, and low population densities have encouraged physical and linguistic mobility. Slave raids among{specify} non-Muslim peoples, internal slave trade, and exports of captives northward from the ninth to the twentieth centuries also have resulted in language changes.

Anthropologists view ethnicity as being more than genetics. Like language, ethnicity implies a shared heritage, partly economic, where people of the same ethnic group may share a livelihood, and partly social, taking the form of shared ways of doing things and organizing relations among individuals and groups. Ethnicity also involves a cultural component made up of shared values and a common worldview. Like language, ethnicity is not immutable. Shared ways of doing things change over time and alter a group''s perception of its own identity.

Not only do the social aspects of ethnic identity change but the biological composition (or gene pool) also may change over time. Although most ethnic groups emphasize intermarriage, people are often proscribed from seeking partners among close relatives')

I''ve tried to adhere to the Wiki nature in this morning''s edit of Creationism. I accept that the dominant view is anti-Creationist and content myself merely with labeling the critique as such. I have restored much of the original points (as well as memory serves) and pointed out that objections to Creationism are mainly against Sudden Creationism. The argument against ID seems (here, at least) to be only that it''s a religious tenet rather than a scientific hypothesis.

My aim is to summarize and highlight the various arguments, rather than to put forth my own view as right. This is my best effort at achieving NPOV, and I''m sure that any unconscious bias which has slipped through will be boldly corrected by others. --[[User:Ed Poor]]

What''s the ? It is not mainstream Christian theology; I''m sure that the Catholic and the majority of Presbyterian denominations, for example, do not accept Creationism. Acceptance of Creationism is highly related to biblical literalism; many conservative (as opposed to fundamentalist) Christians do not believe in biblical literalism. GregLindahl

:Source of claim: [http://www.gallup.com/poll/releases/pr010214c.asp Gallup poll].

:What makes you think it''s not mainstream theology? Very few of the religious leaders I''ve talked to reject Creationism. And the only survey I''ve seen (reference quoted far below) says 85% of Americans believe it, either as Sudden [[Creationism]] or [[Intelligent Design]].

::Oops! I thought I put that reference here. Maybe it''s on a different Talk page, unless it got accidentally deleted. [[User:Ed Poor]]
::It''s at [[Evolution Poll]]

:I gave 2 examples of why I suspect it isn''t a view held by a majority of Christians. You did read my entire paragraph, right? As for your %, I don''t consider Intelligent Design to be Creationism: it is not falsifiable. You should realize that defining the terms is a very important part of any disagreement, and NPOV applies to that too. GregLindahl

== Definition of Cladistics ==

The current definition of classifying based on shared ancestry is both deeply wrong and uninformative. Ancestry cannot be known in advance of cladistic analysis, so it cannot be said to be a basis for it. Cladistics is distinguished from other fields by classifying according to monophyletic groups (hence ''''''clad''''''istics), which are based on shared derived (or unique) features')

{{History of Cambodia}}

People have been living within the area covered by the present-day country of [[Cambodia]] at least since the 5th millennium BCE. The ancient [[Kingdom of Funan]] occupied a wider area, and it was during that period that the culture became heavily influenced by [[Hinduism]]. The state of [[Chenla]] then arose. The Khmer Empire had its golden age in the 9th to the 13th centuries, when huge temple complexes were built, most notably [[Angkor Wat]]. 

Spanish and Portuguese missionaries visited from the 16th century, and Cambodia became a protectorate of France in the 19th century, being ruled as part of [[French Indochina]]. Cambodia became an independent kingdom in 1953 under [[Sihanouk]]. The [[Vietnam War]] extended into Cambodia, giving rise to the [[Khmer Rouge]], which took Phnom Penh in 1975 and carried out a campaign of mass killing. Following an invasion by Vietnam, the Khmer Rouge were deposed and the [[People''s Republic of Kampuchea]] was established. After years of isolation, the war-ravaged nation was reunited under the monarchy in 1993 and has seen rapid economic progress while rebuilding from decades of civil war.

[[File:Angkor Wat.jpg|thumb|380px|right|The 12th century temple of [[Angkor Wat]] is the masterpiece of Angkorian architecture.  Constructed under the direction of the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] king [[Suryavarman II]], it was to serve as the monarch''s personal mausoleum and as a temple to the [[Hindu]] god [[Vishnu]]. Based on Dravidian architecture, it was designed as a pyramid representing the structure of the universe: the highest level at the center of the temple represented [[Mount Meru]], the home of the Hindu gods, with the five towers on the highest level representing the five peaks of the mountain.  The broad moat around the complex represented the oceans that surround the world.]]
[[File:Chan Chhaya Pavilion.JPG|thumb|380px|right|Khmer style architecture.]]

The period of [[Angkor]] is the period from approximately the latter half of the 8th century AD to the first half of the 15th century.  If precise dates are required, the beginning may be set in 802 AD, when the founder of the [[Khmer Empire]], [[Jayavarman II]] pronounced himself universal monarch (chakravartin) and declared independence from Java, and the end may be set in 1431 AD, when [[Thai people|Thai]] invaders from the kingdom of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] sacked Angkor and caused the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] elite to migrate to [[Phnom Penh]].

In any study of Angkorian architecture, the emphasis is necessarily on religious architecture, since all the remaining Angkorian buildings are religious in nature.  During the period of Angkor, only temples and other religious buildings were constructed of stone.  Non-religious buildings such as dwellings were constructed of perishable materials such as wood, and so have not survived.

The religious architecture of [[Angkor]] has characteristic structures, elements, and motifs, which are identified in the glossary below.  Since a number of different architectural styles succeeded one another during the Angkorean period, not all of these features were equally in evidence throughout the period.  Indeed, scholars have referred to the presence or absence of such features as one source of evidence for dating the remains.

==Periodization==
Scholars have worked to develop a periodization of Angkorian architectural styles. The following periods and styles may be distinguished.  Each is named for a particular temple regarded as paradigmatic for the style.')

[[Cameroon]]''s noncontentious, low-profile approach to foreign relations puts it squarely in the middle of other [[Africa]]n and developing country states on major issues. It supports the principles of [[noninterference]] in the affairs of third world countries and increased assistance to underdeveloped countries. Cameroon is an active participant in the [[United Nations]], where its voting record demonstrates its commitment to causes that include international [[peacekeeping]], the [[rule of law]], [[environmentalism|environmental protection]], and [[Third World]] economic development. In the UN and other [[human rights]] fora, Cameroon''s non-confrontational approach has generally led it to avoid criticizing other countries.

Cameroon enjoys good [[Cameroon-United States relations|relations with the United States]] and other developed countries. Cameroon enjoys generally good relations with its African neighbors. It supports UN peacekeeping activities in [[Central Africa]].

==Constitutional Modernisation==
Constitutional Modernisation has come to the forefront of politics recently with the collapse of the now defunct [[Euro Bank Corporation]] in 2003. The prosecution in the trial was forced to reveal that the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] had planted [[Mole (espionage)|moles]] (and used wire taps) throughout the banking industry using [[MI6]], with the consent of the [[Governor of the Cayman Islands|Governor]]. This caused the trial''s collapse, and subsequent release of those charged with wrongdoing. Along with this, the only mole that was known at the time was allowed to leave the country, never to answer for what he (or the United Kingdom) was doing. This infuriated the elected members of the Legislative Assembly as they maintained that the Governor and the United Kingdom had put into question the Cayman Islands'' reputation as a tightly regulated offshore jurisdiction. Some saw this as the United Kingdom meddling in the territory''s affairs to benefit itself (and the EU), at the expense of the islands'' economy. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Constitutional talks however went on hold following [[Hurricane Ivan]] in 2004. Subsequently in May 2005 the ruling UDP was ousted by the PPM, which restarted the process of constitutional modernisation. The new constitution took effect on 6 November 2009.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The ''''''foreign relations of the [[Cayman Islands]]'''''' are largely managed from the [[United Kingdom]], as the islands remain an [[British overseas territories|overseas territory]] of the UK. However, the [[Government of the Cayman Islands]] often resolves important issues with foreign governments alone, without intervention from Britain. Although in its early days, the Cayman Islands'' most important relationships were with Britain and [[Jamaica]], in recent years, this has shifted, and they now rely more so on the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

Though the Cayman Islands are involved in no major international disputes, they have come under some criticism due to the use of their territory for [[narcotics trafficking]] and [[money laundering]]. In an attempt to address this, the Government entered into the Narcotics Agreement of 1984 and the [[Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty]] of 1986 with the United States, in order to reduce the use of their facilities associated with these activities. In more recent years, they have stepped up the fight against money laundering, by limiting banking secrecy, introducing requirements for customer identification and record keeping, and requiring banks to cooperate with foreign investigators.

Due to their status as an overseas territory of the UK, the Cayman Islands have no representation either on the [[United Nations]], or in most other international organizations. However, the Cayman Islands still participates in some international organisations, being a full member of the [[Central Development Bank]] and [[International Olympic Committee]], an associate member of [[Caricom]] and [[UNESCO]], and a member of a subbureau of [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]].

The country''s economic development was successively marked by the export of first agricultural produce, then [[sodium nitrate|saltpeter]] and later [[copper]]. The wealth of raw materials led to an economic upturn, but also led to dependency, and even wars with neighboring states. Chile was governed during most of its first 150 years of independent life by different forms of restricted government, where the electorate was carefully vetted and controlled by an elite.

[[Croatia]] first appeared as a [[duchy]] in the late 8th century and then as a kingdom in the 10th century. From the 12th century it remained a distinct state with its ruler (''''[[ban (title)|ban]]'''') and [[Croatian Parliament|parliament]], but it obeyed the kings and emperors of various neighboring powers, primarily [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Habsburg|Austria]]. 

The period from the 15th to the 17th centuries was marked by bitter struggles with the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After being incorporated in [[Yugoslavia]] for most of the 20th century, Croatia regained independence in 1991.

The ''''''politics of Croatia'''''' are defined by a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] framework, where the [[Prime Minister of Croatia]] is the head of government in a multi-party system. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government and the [[President of Croatia]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[Croatian Parliament]] ({{lang-hr|Sabor}}). The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. The parliament adopted the current [[Constitution of Croatia]] on 22 December 1990 and decided to declare independence from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The declaration of independence came into effect on 8 October 1991. The constitution has since been amended several times. The first modern parties in the country developed in the middle of the 19th century, and their agenda and appeal changed, reflecting major social changes, such as the breakup of [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], dictatorship and social upheavals in the kingdom, [[World War II]], the establishment of Communist rule and the breakup of the [[SFR Yugoslavia]].

The President of the Republic ({{lang-hr|Predsjednik Republike}}) is the [[head of state]] and the [[commander in chief]] of the [[Military of Croatia|Croatian armed forces]] and is directly elected to serve a five-year term. The [[Government of Croatia|government]] ({{lang-hr|Vlada}}), the main executive power of Croatia, is headed by the prime minister, who has four deputy prime ministers, three of whom also serve as government ministers. Seventeen ministers are in charge of particular activities. The executive branch is responsible for proposing legislation and a budget, executing the laws, and guiding the foreign and internal policies. The [[Parliament of Croatia|parliament]] is a [[unicameral]] legislative body. The number of Sabor representatives ranges from 100 to 160; they are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The powers of the legislature include enactment and amendment of the constitution and laws; adoption of the [[government budget]], declarations of war and peace, defining national boundaries, calling [[referendum|referenda]] and elections, appointments and relief of officers, supervising the Government of Croatia and other holders of public powers responsible to the Sabor, and granting of amnesties.

== History ==
[[Croatia]]n [[foreign policy]] has focused on greater [[Euro-Atlantic]] integration, mainly entering the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]. In order to gain access to European and [[Transatlantic relations|trans-Atlantic]] institutions, it has had to undo many negative effects of the breakup of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and the war that ensued, and improve and maintain good relations with its neighbors.

Key issues over the last decade have been the implementation of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]] and the [[Erdut Agreement]], nondiscriminatory facilitation of the return of [[refugee]]s and [[displaced person]]s from the 1991-95 war including property restitution for ethnic [[Serbs]], resolution of border disputes with [[Slovenia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]], and general [[Democracy|democratization]].

Croatia has had an uneven record in these areas between 1996 and 1999 during the [[right-wing]] [[Croatian Democratic Union|HDZ]] government, inhibiting its relations with the European Union and the U.S. Improvement in these areas severely hindered the advance of Croatia''s prospects for further Euro-Atlantic integration.

Generally speaking, a ''''''calendar year'''''' begins on the [[New Year''s Day]] of the given [[calendar]] system and ends on the day before the following New Year''s Day. By convention, a calendar year consists of a [[natural number]] of [[day]]s. To reconcile the calendar year with an astronomical cycle (which could not possibly be reckoned in a whole number of days), certain years contain [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|extra days]]. Through further insertion of non-day units of time, the calendar year can be further synchronized; however, these extra units of time are not considered part of the calendar.

The [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] year begins on January 1 and ends on December 31 with a length of 365 days in an ordinary year and 366 days in a [[leap year]] giving an average length of 365.2425 days. Other formula-based calendars can have lengths which are further out of step with the solar cycle, for example, the [[Julian calendar]] has an average length of 365.25 days, and the [[Hebrew calendar]] has an average length of 365.2468 days.

The astronomer''s [[mean tropical year]] which is averaged over equinoxes and solstices is currently 365.24219 days, slightly shorter than the average length of the year in most calendars, but the astronomer''s value changes over time, so [[William Herschel]]''s suggested correction to the Gregorian calendar may become unnecessary by the year 4000.

== Quarters ==

The calendar year can be divided into 4 quarters, often abbreviated Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4:

* First quarter: from the beginning of January to the end of March
* Second quarter: from the beginning of April to the end of June
* Third quarter: from the beginning of July to the end of September
* Fourth quarter: from the beginning of October to the end of December

''''''Cymbals'''''' are a common [[percussion instrument]]. Cymbals consist of thin, normally round plates of various [[alloys]]; see [[cymbal making]] for a discussion of their manufacture. The majority of cymbals are of indefinite pitch, although small disc-shaped cymbals based on ancient designs sound a definite note (see: [[crotales]]). Cymbals are used in many ensembles ranging from the orchestra, percussion ensembles, jazz bands, heavy metal bands, and marching groups.

{{Community}}

The term ''''''community'''''' has two distinct commutative meanings: 1) Community usually refers to a [[social unit]] larger than a small village that shares common [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. The term can also refer to the [[Nation|national community]] or [[international community]], and 2) in [[biology]], a community is a group of [[interacting]] [[life|living]] [[organism]]s sharing a populated [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

In [[human]] communities, [[intention|intent]], [[belief]], [[Natural resource|resources]], [[preference]]s, [[Need assessment|needs]], [[risk]]s, and a number of other conditions may be present and common, affecting the [[Identity (social science)|identity]] of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.

Since the advent of the [[Internet]], the concept of community has less geographical limitation, as people can now gather virtually in an online community and share common interests regardless of physical location. Prior to the internet, virtual communities (like social or academic organizations) were far more limited by the constraints of available communication and transportation technologies.

A ''''''community college'''''' is a type of [[educational institution]]. The term can have different meanings in different countries.

==Australia==
In Australia, the term community college is not used.  Analogous to community colleges are colleges or institutes of Technical and Further Education (TAFEs); public institutions mostly regulated at state and territory level.  There are also an increasing number of private providers of varying social esteem; often these are colloquially called ''colleges''.  

TAFEs and other providers carry on the tradition of adult education, which was established in Australia around mid 19th century when evening classes were held to help adults enhance their numeracy and literacy skills.')

Though ''''''Chicano'''''' was often used to refer to anyone with a [[Mexican American]] background, the users at the time understood it to be mainly applicable to the [[Tejano]] community. Other terms that are used interchangeably with ''''''Chicano'''''' are ''''[[Mexican Americans]]'''', ''''[[Hispanics]]'''', and ''''[[Latinos]]''''.

Your account of consequentialism seems a little unusual.  For starters, I don''t think egoism is normally considered to be a kind of consquentialism.  For example, in ''''Consequentialism and its critics'''', the editor Samuel Scheffler starts off by saying that

: Consequentialism in its purest and simplest form is a moral doctrine which says that the right act in any given situation is the one that will produce the best overall outcome, ''''as judged from an impersonal standpoint which gives equal weight to the interests of everyone.'''' Somewhat more precisely, we may think of a consequentialist theory of this kind as coming in two parts.  First, it gives')

Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right act (or omission) is one that will produce a good outcome, or consequence.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Consequentialism is usually distinguished from [[deontological ethics]] (or ''''deontology''''), in that deontology derives the rightness or wrongness of one''s conduct from the character of the behaviour itself rather than the outcomes of the conduct. It is also distinguished from [[virtue ethics]], which focuses on the character of the agent rather than on the nature or consequences of the act (or omission) itself, and [[pragmatic ethics]] which treats morality like science: advancing socially over the course of many lifetimes, such that any moral criterion is subject to revision. Consequentialist theories differ in how they define [[Value theory|moral goods]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The voice is produced by [[castration]] of the singer before [[puberty]], or it occurs in one who, because of an [[endocrinology|endocrinological]] condition, never reaches [[sexual maturity]].

Castration before puberty (or in its early stages) prevents a boy''s [[larynx]] from being transformed by the [[Voice cracking|normal physiological events]] of puberty. As a result, the [[vocal range]] of prepubescence (shared by both sexes) is largely retained, and the voice develops into adulthood in a unique way. Prepubescent castration for this purpose diminished greatly in the late 18th century and was made illegal in Italy in 1870.

As the castrato''s body grew, his lack of testosterone meant that his [[epiphyses]] (bone-joints) did not harden in the normal manner.

''''''Chinese numerals'''''' are characters for writing [[number]]s in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. Today speakers of Chinese use three [[numeral system]]s:
the [[Arabic numerals|Indian (Arabic)]] system used world-wide and two indigenous systems.

The more familiar indigenous system are [[Chinese character]]s that correspond to [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals in the spoken language]]{{disambiguation needed|date=May 2012}}. These are shared with other languages of the [[Chinese cultural sphere]] such as Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese. Most people and institutions in China primarily use the Indian (Arabic) system for convenience, with traditional Chinese numerals used in finance, mainly for writing amounts on checks and banknotes and some ceremonial occasions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The other indigenous system is the [[Suzhou numerals]], or ''''huama'''', a positional system. It is the only surviving form of the [[rod numerals]]. They were once used by Chinese mathematicians, and later in Chinese markets, such as those in [[Hong Kong]] before the 1990s, but has been gradually supplanted by the Arabic numerals and also the Roman numerals.

==Do calendars really measure time?==

I think a lot of misconceptions about calendars arise from the idea that a calendar measures time, like a clock or like a ruler measures distance.

All known calendars work by naming days (This is the definition in the Nupedia article). As such, a calendar can not measure time more accurately than 1 day. 
Furthermore, the duration of the day is known to vary in time owing to change in Earth''s rotation rate, so is not a good standard in time measurement.

A [[:solar calendar|solar calendar]] may measure years, by virtue of the fact that its year runs close to the cycle of seasons, but more accurate measurement can be got from an [[:ephemeris|ephemeris]]. 

The [[:year|year]] even when measured in SI [[:second|second]]s, varies in duration and so can not be considered a unit of the same time that measured by SI seconds.

I understand the games, but I''ve seen each of these Chinese terms spelled many ways, and I know nothing about proper transliteration of Chinese.  I would appreciate it if someone (we do have at least one Wikipedian who seems to know this well) would edit this to make all the transliterations consistent.  I believe the Cantonese names are the most commonly used in American casinos (I only know about the tiles from Pai Gow), but I imagine Mandarin Tien Gow players might use different ones.  --[[User:Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]

----

Since Tien Gow and Pai Gow are games mostly played in southern China, the terms used should be transliterated according to the Cantonese dialect.  In Hong Kong, the game of Tien Gow is refered to as Tin Kau in official papers; Pai Pow is refered to as Pai Kau.  And you already know what American Casinos use.  It is impossible to unify the spelling because I don''t know if there is any formal transliteration standards for Cantonese.  

I know that Mandarin has at least three very formal transliteration standards known as Pinyin (Mainland China), Zhuyin (Taiwan) and Wade-Giles systems (historical).  Many well known old words were transliterated using the Wade-Giles system developed in the 19th century.  That explains the different spellings of Peking vs. Beijing and Ching Dynasty vs. Qing Dynasty etc.  As long as every reader understands that all these terms are written phonetically, then they need not insist on consistent spelling.

The Chinese dominoes are used in northern Chinese games also.  Gwat Pai is an example.  If we go by its local name, then we should transliterate it to Goo Pai in Mandarin or something else in Hu-nan dialect.  But then one may argue that Gwat Pai should be used just to be consistent with other Cantonese on the same page.  Who decides what is right?  If these pages are transliterated in Cantonese, the Mandarin speaking readers will object.  Same case vice versa.  There are countless dialects used in China, and most Chinese games are regional and their terms are expressed usually in local dialects.  We can never please everyone at once.  You''ll have inconsistency whatever you pick.  If this is a book, the author decides whatever he likes.  But this Wikipedia is co-authored by writers around the world.  What should be the standard or policy?

In my opinion, we should not put too much effort in fo')

[[Colombia]] seeks diplomatic and commercial relations with all countries, regardless of their ideologies or [[politics|political]] or economic systems. For this reason, the Colombian economy is quite open, relying on international trade and following the guidelines given by [[international law]].

Since 2008, Colombia''s Ministry of Trade and Commerce has either reached or strengthened Bilateral Trade Agreements with S. Korea, Japan and China, building stronger commerce interchange and development in the Pacific Rim.

Regional relations have also vastly improved under the Santos Administration (2010-current) . Issues however remain regarding spillover of the FARC leftist-terrorist group, being chased out of hiding in rural areas of Colombia and finding save-havens in non-monitored areas of bordering states. The FARC numbers have significantly diminished in the last decade to an estimated 5000-7,000. And while joint-military collaboration  has steady increased with the bordering countries of [[Brazil]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], and [[Venezuela]], the [[Ecuadorian]] government, under the Correa administration has done little in assisting the issue.  In 2002, the Ecuadorian government made a controversial move when they closed its main border crossing with Colombia. Since that time, the main crossing, is only allowed to operate on certain hours of the day. Evidence has since emerged however, suggesting that a significant number of the FARC''s foot-soldiers in and around the Colombia-Ecuador boarder, consist of Ecuadorian')

{{Politics of the Czech Republic}}
Until the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989, the foreign policy of [[Czechoslovakia]] had followed that of the [[Soviet Union]]. Since the revolution and the subsequent mutually-agreed [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|peaceful dissolution]] of Czechoslovakia into the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], the [[Czechs]] have made integration with Western institutions their chief foreign policy objective. This goal was rapidly met with great success, as the nation joined [[NATO]] in 1999 and the European Union in 2004, and held the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency of the European Union]] during the first half of 2009.

==Participation in international organizations==
The Czech Republic participates in the [[United Nations]] (UN); [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO); [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF); [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD); [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA); North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the [[International Whaling Commission]].

Fundamental to this objective is Czech membership in the European Union. The Czech Republic became a member of the EU in May 2004. This followed signature of the Treaty of Accession with nine other candidate nations in 1993. Although there have been disagreements with established EU member nations over some economic issues, such as agricultural quotas and a recent{{When|date=November 2010}} amendment to the gaming law, relations are good.

The Czech Republic is a member of the United Nations and participates in its specialized agencies. It is a member of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]]. It maintains diplomatic relations with more than 85 countries, of which 63 have permanent representation in Prague. The Czech Republic became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, along with Poland and Hungary, on 12 March 1999. This membership represents a milestone in the country''s foreign policy and security orientation.

Liechtenstein claims restitution for {{convert|1600|km2|abbr=on}} (which is ten times the size of Liechtenstein) of land in the Czech Republic confiscated from its princely family in 1918 by the then newly established state of Czechoslovakia, the predecessor of the Czech Republic; the Czech Republic insists that the power to claim restitution does not go back before February 1948, when the Communists seized power; Liechtenstein did not diplomatically recognize the Czech Republic until 2009, and the Czech Republic in turn did not diplomatically recognize Liechtenstein.

A ''''''cultural movement'''''' is a change in the way a number of different disciplines approach their work. This embodies all [[art]] forms, the [[science]]s, and [[philosophies]]. Historically, different nations or regions of the world have gone through their own independent sequence of movements in [[culture]], but as world communications have accelerated this geographical distinction has become less distinct. When cultural movements go through revolutions from one to the next, genres tend to get attacked and mixed up, and often new genres are generated and old ones fade. These changes are often reactions against the prior cultural form, which typically has grown stale and repetitive. An obsession emerges among the mainstream with the new movement, and the old one falls into neglect - sometimes it dies out entirely, but often it chugs along favored in a few disciplines and occasionally making reappearances (sometimes prefixed with')

''''''Catalysis'''''' is  the increase in [[reaction rate|rate]] of a [[chemical reaction]] due to the participation of a substance called a catalyst. Unlike other [[reagent]]s in the chemical reaction, a catalyst is not consumed. A catalyst may participate in multiple chemical transformations. The effect of a catalyst may vary due to the presence of other substances known as inhibitors or poisons (which reduce the catalytic activity) or promoters (which increase the activity).

Catalyzed reactions have a lower [[activation energy]] (rate-limiting [[free energy (thermodynamics)|free energy]] of activation) than the corresponding uncatalyzed reaction, resulting in a higher reaction rate at the same temperature. However, the mechanistic explanation of catalysis is complex. Catalysts may affect the reaction environment favorably, or bind to the reagents to polarize bonds, e.g. [[acid catalyst]]s for reactions of [[carbonyl]] compounds, or form specific intermediates that are not produced naturally, such as osmate [[ester]]s in [[osmium tetroxide]]-catalyzed [[dihydroxylation]] of [[alkene]]s, or cause [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] of reagents to reactive forms, such as [[chemisorption|chemisorbed hydrogen]] in [[catalytic hydrogenation]].

Usually, the catalyst participates in this slowest step, and rates are limited by amount of catalyst and its')

''''''Continuum mechanics'''''' is a branch of [[mechanics]] that deals with the analysis of the [[kinematics]] and the mechanical behavior of materials modeled as a continuous mass rather than as discrete particles. The French mathematician [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] was the first to formulate such models in the 19th century, but research in the area continues today.

==Explanation==
{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Branches}}
Modeling an object as a continuum assumes that the substance of the object completely fills the space it occupies. Modeling objects in this way ignores the fact that matter is made of [[atom]]s, and so is not continuous; however, on [[length scale]]s much greater than that of inter-atomic distances, such models are highly accurate. Fundamental physical laws such as the [[conservation of mass]], the [[conservation of momentum]], and the [[conservation of energy]] may be applied to such models to derive [[differential equations]] describing the behavior of such objects, and some information about the particular material studied is added through a [[constitutive relation]].

Continuum mechanics deals with physical properties of solids and fluids which are independent of any particular [[coordinate system]] in which they are observed. These physical properties are then represented by [[tensor]]s, which are mathematical objects that have the required property of being independent of coordinate system. These tensors can be expressed in coordinate systems for computational convenience.

''''''Constitutional law'''''' is the body of law which defines the relationship of different entities within a [[State (polity)|state]], namely, the [[executive (government)|executive]], the [[legislature]], and the [[judiciary]].

Not all [[nation state]]s have codified [[constitution]]s, though all such states have a ''''[[jus commune]]'''', or law of the land, that may consist of a variety of imperative and consensual rules. These may include [[customary law]], [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], [[statutory law]], [[judge-made law]] or [[international law|international rules and norms]].

==Functions of constitutions==

===State and legal structure===
Constitutional laws may often be considered second order rulemaking or rules about making rules to exercise power. It governs the relationships between the judiciary, the legislature and the executive with the bodies under its authority. One of the key tasks of constitutions within this context is to indicate hierarchies and relationships of power. For example, in a [[unitary state]], the constitution will vest ultimate authority in one central administration and [[legislature]], and [[judiciary]], though there is often a delegation of power or authority to local or municipal authorities.

Most, if not all, Chinese [[input method]]s fall into one of the two categories: phonetic readings or root shapes. Methods under the phonetic category usually are easier to learn but are less efficient, thus result in slower typing speed (because it typically requires user to choose from a list of phonetically similar characters for input); whereas methods under the root shape category allow very precise and speedy input but has a steeper learning curve (because they often require a thorough understanding in character''s strokes and composition) .

The Djohar regime reached an agreement in 1990 to link Moroni and Brussels by air.

INSERT INTO articles (title, created_at, updated_at, body) values ('Computational chemistry', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '''''''Computational chemistry'''''' is a branch of [[chemistry]] that uses principles of [[computer science]] to assist in solving chemical problems. It uses the results of [[theoretical chemistry]], incorporated into efficient [[computer program]]s, to calculate the structures and properties of [[molecule]]s and solids. Its necessity arises from the well-known fact that apart from relatively recent results concerning the [[Dihydrogen cation|hydrogen molecular ion]] (see references therein for more details), the quantum [[n-body problem]] cannot be solved analytically, much less in closed form.  While its results normally complement the information obtained by chemical [[experiment]]s, it can in some cases predict hitherto unobserved chemical [[phenomena]]. It is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials.

Examples of such properties are structure (i.e. the expected positions of the constituent atoms), absolute and [[interaction energy|relative]] (interaction) [[energy|energies]], [[electron]]ic [[charge density|charge distribution]]s, [[dipole]]s and higher [[multipole moment]]s, [[vibrational spectroscopy|vibrational frequencies]], [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] or other [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] quantities, and [[cross section (physics)|cross sections]] for [[scattering theory|collision]] with other particles.

The methods employed cover both static and dynamic situations. In all cases the computer time and other resources (such as memory and disk space) increase rapidly with the size of the system being studied.  That system can be a single molecule, a group of molecules, or a solid.  Computational chemistry methods range from highly accurate to very approximate; highly accurate methods are typically feasible only for small systems. [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''''Ab initio'''' methods]] are based entirely on theory from first principles.  Other (typically less accurate) methods are called empirical or semi-empirical because they employ experimental results, often from acceptable models of atoms or related molecules, to approximate some elements of the underlying theory.

Both ''''ab initio'''' and semi-empirical approaches involve approximations.  These range from simplified forms of the first-principles equations that are easier or faster to solve, to approximations limiting the size of the system (for example, [[periodic boundary conditions]]), to fundamental approximations to the underlying equations that are required to achieve any solution to them at all.  For example, most ''''ab initio'''' calculations make the [[Born')

''''''Calvinism'''''' (also called the ''''''Reformed tradition'''''' or the ''''''Reformed faith'''''') is a major branch of [[Western Christianity]] that follows the theological tradition and forms of Christian practice of [[John Calvin]] and other [[Reformation]]-era theologians.  Calvinists broke with the [[Roman Catholic]] church but differed with [[Lutherans]] on the [[real presence]] of Christ in the [[Lord''s supper]], [[regulative principle of worship|theories of worship]], and the [[Law and Gospel#Lutheran and Reformed differences|use of God''s law for believers]], among other things.')

{{Politics}}
A ''''''coalition government'''''' (known in the United States as a ''''''fusion administration'''''') is a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] government in which several [[political party|political parties]] cooperate, reducing the dominance of any one party within that coalition. The usual reason given for this arrangement is that no party on its own can achieve a majority in the [[parliament]]. A coalition government might also be created in a time of national difficulty or crisis, for example during wartime, or economic crisis, to give a government the high degree of perceived [[Legitimacy (political science)|political legitimacy]], or [[collective identity]] it desires whilst also playing a role in diminishing internal political strife. In such times, parties have formed ''''''all-party coalitions'''''' ([[national unity government]]s, [[grand coalition]]s). If a coalition collapses, a [[Motion of Confidence|confidence vote]] is held or a [[motion of no confidence]] is taken.

==Practice==
{{Section OR|date=June 2009}}
To deal with a situation in which no clear majorities appear through general elections, parties either form coalition cabinets, supported by a parliamentary majority, or [[Minority government|minority cabinets]] which may consist of one or more parties. Cabinets based on a coalition with majority in a parliament, ideally, are more stable and long-lived than minority cabinets. While the former are prone to internal struggles, they have less reason to fear votes of non-confidence. [[Majority government]]s based on a single party are typically even more stable, as long as their majority can be maintained. 

''''''Coalition cabinets'''''' are common in countries in which a parliament is [[proportional representation|proportionally representative]], with several organized political parties represented. It usually does not appear in countries in which the cabinet is chosen by the [[Executive (government)|executive]] rather than by a lower house, such as in the [[United States]] (however, coalition cabinets are common in [[Brazil]]). In [[semi-presidential system]]s such as [[France]], where the president formally appoints a [[prime minister]] but the government itself must still maintain the confidence of parliament, coalition governments occur quite regularly.

''''''Canonization'''''' (or ''''''canonisation'''''') is the act by which the [[Catholic Church]] or [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] declares a deceased person to be a [[saint]], upon which declaration the person is included in the canon, or list, of recognized saints. Originally, individuals were recognized as saints without any formal process (as it is still done in the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Church]]).{{fix

}} The process is most commonly used in, although not limited to, the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].

==Historical development of the process==

The first people the Roman Catholic Church honored as saints were the [[martyr]]s. Pious legends of their deaths were considered to affirm the truth of their faith in Christ, and formalization and celebration of these legends served to legitimize and propagate the doctrines of the Church and serve as examples.

The [[Latin Rite]]''s Canon of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] contains the names only of martyrs, along with that of the [[Virgin Mary]] and, since 1962, that of [[Saint Joseph]].

== Misinterpretation of the Bohrian view ==

I believe that this article incorrectly attributes a positivist slant to Bohrs interpretation. Although this is indeed the view taken by his student Heisenberg, and is often taken as being representative of the copenhagen interpretation, it is not true of Bohrs ideas (regardless of whether they make it into the definition of the cophenhagen interpretation). I myself still struggle to come to terms with Bohrs relationist notions of measurement and reality, but I am certain that it is unfortunately not as simple as a positivism.

Also with regards to whether interpretations of QM is a subject for physics or metaphysics, it is as much physics as Einsteins deriving of the lorentz transformations (ie. special relativity). Both attempt to clarify and extend an existing operationally adequete although conceptually incomplete theory by questioning what relation the theory has to reality.

Summarising:

The original assertion about the inaccessibles was inaccurate and has been amended by [[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]]. The page has moved from [[:Cardinal|Cardinal]] to [[:Cardinal number|Cardinal number]].

Someone should explain what the following types of cardinals are: inaccessible, Mahlo, indescribable, ineffable, partition, Ramsey, measurable, strongly compact, supercompact, extendible, huge.

:Yeah, I second that. I want a description of indescribable numbers, and quick! The huge ones are easy though. They are just HUGE, man.

The definition of ''''n''''-hyperinaccessible doesn''t seem to be complete; so far, it only works for natural numbers ''''n'''' but I think we want it for all cardinal numbers ''''n''''. --[[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]] 19:15, August 29, 2001 (UTC)

Does anyone have a more formal definition of Mahlo cardinals? 20:10,  (''''unsigned by 62.8.212.xxx December 31, 2001 (UTC)'''')

I think we should start with the everyday definition of cardinal (as opposed to ordinal) numbers. Only then should we progress to the more general (and abtruse) case described here. This is a deeply scary article :-)

''''Others interpret the precept against killing to mean human beings and thus indulge in omnivorous behavior.'''' .. Is that correct?  What is the source of this information?  I have personally never met a single person who held such a view.  In my experience, most lay Chinese ''Buddhists'' continue to eat meat purely because they think it tastes nice.  Becoming vegetarian seems to be something that is viewed as rather extreme, or something that old people do. --[[User:Pratyeka|Pratyeka]] 04:20, 19 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Question:  are they vegetarian or vegan dishes?  That is, you mention that they don''t use animal products, including lard; if they don''t use any at all in the preparation, including for instance eggs, beef broths, honey, etc. then they are in fact vegan.

:in that sense I believe they can be vegan dishes.  I am not a buddhist myself, so I cannot confirm the answer.  For example, some buddhists allow eggs in their diet, so some restaurant may prepare vegetarian or vegan dishes depending on the customer request.

Further question:  so since Buddhists are opposed to the killing of animals, they are themselves vegans, aren''t they?  i.e. they don''t eat animal products or use them in any other way, including to wear?

:Buddhism are practiced in many ways in China.  Buddhist monks are vegan for sure.  A friend of mine only removed beef from her diet as her pledge to the Buddha.  She eats chicken and pork like everyone does.
::Most (all?) monks in ''Tibet'' are ''''''not'''''' vegetarian.  --[[User:Pratyeka|prat]] 01:46, 2004 Feb 17 (UTC)
:Oh.  Well, vegans don''t eat or use any animal products in any way.

Also, I think this article might be moved to [[:Chinese Buddhist cuisine|Chinese Buddhist cuisine]].  Or maybe that will be corrected automatically with the new UseModWiki upload?

:Why should buddhist be capitalized?

''''''CITES'''''' (the ''''''Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora'''''', also known as the ''''''Washington Convention'''''') is a [[multilateral treaty]], drafted as a result of a resolution adopted in 1963 at a meeting of members of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). The convention was opened for signature in 1973, and CITES entered into force on 1 July 1975. Its aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten the survival of the species in the wild, and it accords varying degrees of protection to more than 34,000 [[species]] of animals and plants. In order to ensure that the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) was not violated, the Secretariat of GATT was consulted during the drafting process.')

Computationally, a context-sensitive language is equivalent with a linear bounded [[nondeterministic Turing machine]], also called a [[linear bounded automaton]].

This means that every formal language that can be decided by such a machine is a context-sensitive language, and every context-sensitive language can be decided by such a machine.

This set of languages is also known as ''''''NLIN-SPACE'''''', because they can be accepted using linear space on a non-deterministic Turing machine.  The class ''''''LIN-SPACE'''''' is defined the same, except using a [[Deterministic automaton|deterministic]] Turing machine.

==Sharing the benefits of biodiversity with developing nations==
Your article simply ignores the discussion on biopiracy and the fact that the Convention calls for the sharing of the results of research and development of products that derive from communities that bare the traditional knowledge of the use of this biodiversity. Pharmaceutic companies are supposed to pay for the use of indigenous knowledge, an area in which developed nations fail to meet their commitments with the Convention. These commitments are made clear in articles 15 and 19 of the Convention:

Article 15. Access to Genetic Resources

1. Recognizing the sovereign rights of States over their natural resources, the authority to determine access to genetic resources rests with the national governments and is subject to national legislation.
(...)

7. Each Contracting Party shall take legislative, administrative or policy measures, as appropriate, and in accordance with Articles 16 and 19 and, where necessary, through the financial mechanism established by Articles 20 and 21 with the aim of ''''''sharing in a fair and equitable way the results of research and development and the benefits arising from the commercial and other utilization of genetic resources'''''' with the Contracting Party providing such resources. Such sharing shall be upon mutually agreed terms.

Article 19. Handling of Biotechnology and Distribution of its Benefits

1. Each Contracting Party shall take legislative, administrative or policy measures, as appropriate, to provide for the effective participation in biotechnological research activities by those Contracting Parties, especially developing countries, which provide the genetic resources for such research, and where feasible in such Contracting Parties.

It is located outside the [[cell membrane]] and provides these cells with structural support and protection, in addition to acting as a filtering mechanism. A major function of the cell wall is to act as a pressure vessel, preventing [[Cytolysis|over-expansion]] when water enters the [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. Cell walls are found in [[plant]]s, [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], [[algae]], and some [[archaea]]. [[Animal]]s and [[protozoa]] do not have cell walls.

The material in the cell wall varies between species, and can also differ depending on cell type and developmental stage. In bacteria, [[peptidoglycan]] forms the cell wall. Archaean cell walls have various compositions, and may be formed of [[glycoprotein]] [[S-layer]]s, [[pseudopeptidoglycan]], or [[polysaccharide]]s. Fungi possess cell walls made of the [[glucosamine]] polymer [[chitin]], and algae typically possess walls made of glycoproteins and polysaccharides. Unusually, [[diatom]]s have a cell wall composed of [[biogenic silica]]. Often, other accessory molecules are found anchored to the cell wall.

== Properties ==
[[Image:Eukaryota cell strucutre.PNG|thumb|250px|right|Diagram of the plant cell, with the cell wall in green.]]

The cell wall serves a similar purpose in those organisms that possess them.  The wall gives cells rigidity and strength, offering protection against mechanical stress.  In multicellular organisms, it permits the organism to build and hold its shape ([[morphogenesis]]).  The cell wall also limits the entry of large molecules that may be toxic to the cell.  It further permits the creation of a stable [[osmotic]] environment by preventing [[Cytolysis|osmotic lysis]] and helping to retain water.  The composition, properties, and form of the cell wall may change during the [[cell cycle]] and depend on growth conditions.

=== Rigidity of cell walls ===
The rigidity of the cell walls is often overestimated. In most cells, the cell wall is flexible, meaning that it will bend rather than holding a fixed shape, but has considerable [[te')

Many [[philosophy|philosophies]] and [[worldview]]s have a set of ''''''classical elements'''''' believed to reflect the simplest essential parts and principles of which anything consists or upon which the constitution and fundamental powers of anything are based. Most frequently, ''''classical elements'''' refer to [[#Ancient classic element systems|ancient beliefs]] inspired by natural observation of the [[phases of matter]]; with the classical elements: earth is equivalent to solid, water is equivalent to liquid,  air is eqivalent to gas and fire is equivalent to plasma.

==Greek and Roman tradition==
Fire is one of the four [[classical element]]s in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] and science.  It was commonly associated with the qualities of energy, assertiveness, and passion.

Air is one of the four [[classical element]]s in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] and science.  According to [[Plato]], it is associated with the [[octahedron]]; air is considered to be both hot and wet.

In contemporary [[esotericism|esoteric traditions]], it is commonly associated with the qualities of [[emotion]] and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].

==Greek and Roman tradition==
Water was one of many  ''''archai'''' proposed by the Pre-socratics, most of whom tried to reduce all things to a single substance. However, [[Empedocles]] of Acragas (c. 495-c. 435 BC) selected four archai for his four roots: [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], water and [[Earth (classical element)|earth]]. Empedocles roots became the four classical elements of Greek philosophy. [[Plato]] (427-347 BC) took over the four elements of Empedocles. In the [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], his major cosmological dialogue, the [[Platonic solid]] associated with water is the [[icosahedron]] which is formed from twenty equilateral triangles.

A ''''''collective trauma'''''' is a traumatic psychological effect shared by a group of people of any size, up to and including an entire society. Traumatic events witnessed by an entire society can stir up collective sentiment, often resulting in a shift in that society''s culture and mass actions.

Well known collective traumas include: The [[John F. Kennedy]] [[assassination]] in the [[United States]], the [[Estonia disaster]] in Sweden, the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States and various others.

Collective traumas have been shown to play a key role in group [[identity formation]] (see: [[Gestalt psychology|Law of Common Fate]]). During [[World War II]], a US submarine, the [[USS Puffer (SS-268)]], came under several hours of [[depth charge]] attack by a Japanese surface vessel until the ship became convinced the submarine had somehow escaped. Psychological studies later showed that crewmen transferred to the submarine after the event were never accepted as part of the [[team]]. Later, US naval policy was changed so that after events of such psychological trauma, the crew would be dispersed to new assignments.

Examples of contemporary collective traumas include:
* [[9/11]]
* [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]
* [[Hurricane Katrina]]

Rehabilitation of survivors becomes extremely difficult when entire nation has experienced such severe traumas as war, genocide, torture, massacre, etc.  Treatment is hardly effective when everybody is traumatized.  Trauma remains chronic and would reproduce itself as long as social causes are not addressed and perpetrators continue to enjoy impunity. The whole society may suffer from an everlasting culture of pain. (1)

The ''''''cut-up technique'''''' is an [[aleatory]] [[literary technique]] in which a [[Writing|text]] is cut up and rearranged to create a new text. 

The concept can be traced to at least the [[Dadaists]] of the 1920s, but was popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by writer [[William S. Burroughs]], and has since been used in a wide variety of contexts.

==Technique==
The cut-up and the closely associated fold-in are the two main techniques:

*''''Cut-up'''' is performed by taking a finished and fully linear text and cutting it in pieces with a few or single words on each piece. The resulting pieces are then rearranged into a new text.
*''''Fold-in'''' is the technique of taking two sheets of linear text (with the same linespacing), folding each sheet in half vertically and combining with the other, then reading across the resulting page.

==History in literature==
A precedent of the technique occurred during a Dadaist rally in the 1920s in which [[Tristan Tzara]] offered to create a [[poem]] on the spot by pulling words at [[random]] from a hat. [[Collage]], which was popularized roughly contemporaneously with the Surrealist movement, sometimes incorporated texts such as newspapers or brochures. Prior to this event, the technique had been published in an issue of 391 in the poem by Tzara, ''''dada manifesto on feeble love and bitter love'''' under the sub-title, ''''TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM''''')

''''''Cretinism'''''' is a condition of severely stunted physical and mental growth due to untreated [[congenital disorder|congenital]] deficiency of [[thyroid]] [[hormone]]s ([[congenital hypothyroidism]]) usually due to maternal [[hypothyroidism]].

==Etymology and use of ''''cretin''''==
The term ''''cretin'''' describes a person so affected, but, as with words such as ''''[[spastic]]'''', ''''[[idiot]]'''' and ''''[[lunatic]]'''', also is a word of abuse. ''''Cretin'''' became a medical term in the 18th century, from an [[Occitan]] and an [[Alps|Alpine]] [[French language|French]] expression, prevalent in a region where persons with such a condition were especially common (see below); it saw wide medical use in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and then spread more widely in popular English as a markedly derogatory term for a person who behaves stupidly. Because of its pejorative connotations in popular speech, health-care workers have mostly abandoned ''''cretin''''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The etymology of ''''cretin'''' is uncertain. Several hypotheses exist. The most common derivation provided in English dictionaries is from the Alpine French dialect pronunciation of the word ''''Chr')

It is kind of semi-supportable. Each segment is up to 4GB, and you can have heaps of segments. It would be a total pain to use this, and hardly anyone ever tried, but it was not quite an outright lie, and it was useful for Intel marketing to claim a bigger address space than Motorola after the bucketing Intel had received for so many years about the small address space of their earlier chips. For practical purposes, the maximum virtual address space of the 386 is not quite 4GB.----
COBOL was not developed by Grace Hopper, although she had a great deal of influence on the original specs. It was developed by a committee called up by the Department of Defense.

[[Image:Clutchdisc.jpg|thumb|right|Single, dry, clutch friction disc. The [[Spline (mechanical)|splined]] hub is attached to the disc with springs to damp chatter.]]
A ''''''clutch'''''' is a [[machine|mechanical device]] that provides for the [[power transmission|transmission of power]] (and therefore usually motion) from one component (the driving member) to another (the driven member) when engaged, but can be disengaged.

Clutches are used whenever the transmission of power or motion must be controlled either in amount or over time (e.g., electric screwdrivers limit how much torque is transmitted through use of a clutch; clutches control whether automobiles transmit engine power to the wheels).

In the simplest application, clutches connect and disconnect two rotating shafts ([[drive shaft]]s or [[line shaft]]s). In these devices, one shaft is typically attached to a motor or other power unit (the driving member) while the other shaft (the driven member) provides output power for work.

In a torque-controlled [[drill]], for instance, one shaft is driven by a motor and the other drives a drill chuck. The clutch connects the two shafts so that they may be locked together and spin at the same speed (engaged), locked together but spinning at different speeds (slipping), or unlocked and spinning at different speeds (disengaged).

A ''''''couplet'''''' is a pair of lines of [[Meter (poetry)|meter]] in poetry. It usually consists of two lines that rhyme and have the same meter.

==Background==
While traditionally couplets rhyme, not all do.  Poems may use white space to mark out couplets if they do not rhyme. Couplets with a meter of [[iambic pentameter]] are called ''''[[heroic couplet]]s''''. The [[Poetic epigram]] is also in the couplet form. Couplets can also appear in more complex rhyme schemes. For example, [[Shakespearean]] [[sonnet]]s end with a couplet.

The assumed antecedent of a conditional proof is called the ''''conditional proof assumption'''' (CPA).  Thus, the goal of a conditional proof is to demonstrate that if the CPA were true, then the desired conclusion [[Logical consequence|necessarily follows]]. Note that the validity of a conditional proof does not require that the CPA is actually true, only that ''''if it is true'''' it leads to the consequent.

Conditional proofs are of great importance in [[mathematics]]. Conditional proofs exist linking several otherwise unproven [[conjecture]]s, so that a proof of one conjecture may immediately imply the validity of several others. It can be much easier to show a proposition''s truth to follow from another proposition than to prove it independently.

A famous network of conditional proofs is the [[NP-complete]] class of complexity theory.  There are a [[List of NP-complete problems|large number]] of interesting tasks, and while it is not known if a polynomial-time solution exists for any of them, it is known that if such a solution exists for any of them, one exists for all of them.

A ''''''cruise missile'''''' is a [[guided missile]] the major portion of whose flight path to its target (a land-based or sea-based target) is conducted at approximately constant velocity; that relies on the dynamic reaction of air for lift, and upon propulsion forces to balance drag. Cruise missiles are designed to deliver a large warhead over long distances with high accuracy. Modern cruise missiles can travel at [[supersonic]] or high [[subsonic flight|subsonic]] speeds, are self-navigating, and can fly on a [[Ballistics|non-ballistic]], extremely low altitude trajectory. They are distinct from [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAV) in that they are used only as weapons and not for [[reconnaissance]]. In a cruise missile, the [[warhead]] is integrated into the vehicle and the vehicle is always sacrificed in the mission.

Cruise missile designs fundamentally derive from the German [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1]] of World War II. Advances in transistor and computer technology have contributed to self-correcting avionic and aeronautical designs that allow missiles to be guided in flight, as opposed to only at launch. These advances developed into [[guided missiles]] and guided bombs, and later into the modern cruise missile.

In 2011, it was estimated that a single [[Tomahawk cruise missile]] costs US$1,410,000.')

''''''Chaosium'''''' is one of the longer lived publishers of [[role-playing game]]s still in existence. Founded by [[Greg Stafford]], its first game was actually a wargame, ''''[[White Bear and Red Moon]]'''', which later mutated into ''''[[Dragon Pass]]'''' and its sequel, ''''[[Nomad Gods]]''''.  ''''White Bear and Red Moon'''' is notable for containing the first published material about [[Glorantha]], later used as the primary setting for the role-playing games ''''[[RuneQuest]]'''', ''''[[Hero Wars]]'''' and ''''[[HeroQuest (role-playing game)|HeroQuest]]''''. Chaosium is the publisher of [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]], based on the stories of [[H.P. Lovecraft]].

== Background ==

The rules of ''''RuneQuest'''', Chaosium''s first role-playing game, were distilled down into a generic, genre-neutral format known as ''''[[Basic Role-Playing]]'''' (''''BRP'''').  These generic rules formed the basis of many of Chaosium''s later RPGs, such as ''''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'''', ''''[[Stormbringer (role-playing game)|Stormbringer]]'''', ''''[[Nephilim (RPG)|Nephilim]]'''', and ''''[[RingworldRPG|Ringworld]]''''.

Chaosium and [[Greg Stafford]] are also responsible for ''''[[Pendragon RPG|Pendragon]]'''', an Arthurian RPG now published by [[White Wolf, Inc.|White Wolf, Inc.''s]] ArtHaus imprint after a spell with [[Green Knight Publishing]]. Other games of note include ''''[[Mythos (role-playing game)|Mythos]]'''', ''''[[Elfquest]]'''', ''''[[Worlds of Wonder (game)|Worlds of Wonder]]'''', ''''[[Superworld]]'''', ''''[[Hawkmoon]]'''', ''''[[Stormbringer]]'''', and the frequently forgotten ''''[[Prince Valiant: The Story-Telling Game]]''''.

Several notable RPG authors have written material for Chaosium, including [[Steve Perrin]], [[Sandy Petersen]], [[Lynn Willis]], [[Keith Herber]], [[David Conyers]], [[Ken St. Andre]], and [[Arduin]] creator [[David A. Hargrave]].

== Magazines ==

Three [[magazine]]s, all of them defunct, had been published by Chaosium to promote its products:

* ''''[[Wyrm''s Footnotes]]'''' ran for fourteen issues from 1976 to 1995. Initially it was a supporting material publication for ''''White Bear and Red Moon'''' but for its 11th issue, in 1981, it had become the official ''''RuneQuest'''' magazine.')

Traditionally, the [[order (biology)|order]] ''''''Ciconiiformes'''''' has included a variety of large, long-legged wading birds with large bills: [[stork]]s, [[heron]]s, [[egret]]s, [[ibis]]es, [[spoonbill]]s, and several others. Ciconiiformes are known from the Late [[Eocene]]. At present the only family retained in the order is the storks, [[Ciconiidae]].

== Taxonomic issues with Ciconiiformes ==

Following the development of research techniques in [[molecular biology]] in the late 20th century, in particular methods for studying [[DNA-DNA hybridisation]], a great deal of new information has surfaced, much of it suggesting that many birds, although looking very different from one another, are in fact more closely related than was previously thought. Accordingly, the radical and influential [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]] greatly enlarged the Ciconiiformes, adding many more families, including most of those usually regarded as belonging to the Sphenisciformes ([[penguin]]s), Gaviiformes ([[diver (bird)|diver]]s), Podicipediformes ([[grebe]]s), [[Procellariiformes]] ([[tubenose|tubenosed seabirds]]), [[Charadriiformes]], ([[wader]]s, [[gull]]s, [[tern]]s and [[auk]]s), [[Pelecaniformes]] ([[pelican]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[gannet]]s and allies), and the [[Falconiformes]] ([[bird of prey|diurnal birds of prey]]). The [[flamingo]] family, Phoenicopteridae, is related, and is sometimes classed as part of the Ciconiiformes.

However, morphological evidence suggests that the traditional Ciconiiformes should be split between two lineages, rather than expanded, although some non-traditional Ciconiiformes may be included in these two lineages.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The exact [[taxonomic]] placement of [[New World Vulture]]s remains unclear.')

INSERT INTO articles (title, created_at, updated_at, body) values ('Cofinality', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '{{Distinguish|cofiniteness}}
In [[mathematics]], especially in [[order theory]], the ''''''cofinality'''''' cf(''''A'''') of a [[partially ordered set]] ''''A'''' is the least of the [[cardinality|cardinalities]] of the [[cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] subsets of ''''A''''. 

This definition of cofinality relies on the [[axiom of choice]], as it uses the fact that every non-empty set of [[cardinal number]]s has a least member. The cofinality of a partially ordered set ''''A'''' can alternatively be defined as the least [[ordinal number|ordinal]] ''''x'''' such that there is a function from ''''x'''' to ''''A'''' with cofinal [[Image (mathematics)|image]]. This second definition makes sense without the axiom of choice. If the axiom of choice is assumed, as will be the case in the rest of this article, then the two definitions are equivalent.

Cofinality can be similarly defined for a [[directed set]] and is used to generalize the notion of a [[subsequence]] in a [[Net (mathematics)|net]].

== Examples ==
*  The cofinality of a partially ordered set with [[greatest element]] is 1 as the set consisting only of the greatest element is cofinal (and must be contained in every other cofinal subset).
** In particular, the cofinality of any nonzero finite ordinal, or indeed any finite directed set, is 1, since such sets have a greatest element.
* Every cofinal subset of a partially ordered set must contain all [[maximal ele')

=== Civilian and militarized heavy equipment ===
[[Image:D9-us pic28m.jpg|300px|thumb|USMC [[Caterpillar D9]] [[armored bulldozer]]. The civilian tractor is fitted with an armor kit, produced by [[Israel Military Industries]].]]
Military engineering can employ a wide variety of [[Heavy equipment (construction)|heavy equipment]] in the same or similar ways to how this equipment is used outside the military.  [[Bulldozer]]s, [[crane (machine)|crane]]s, [[grader]]s, [[excavator]]s, [[dump truck]]s, loaders, and backhoes all see extensive use by military engineers.

Military engineers may also use civilian heavy equipment which was modified for military applications. Typically, this involves adding armour for protection from battlefield hazards such as artillery, unexploded ordnance, mines, and small arms fire.  Often this protection is provided by [[armour plate]]s and steel jackets.  Some examples of armoured civilian heavy equipment are the [[IDF Caterpillar D9]], American D7 TPK, Canadian D6 [[Armored bulldozer|armoured bulldozer]], cranes, graders, excavators, and [[M35 2-1/2 ton cargo truck]].

Militarized heavy equipment may also take on the form of traditional civilian equipment designed and built to unique military specifications.  These vehicles typically sacrifice some depth of capability from civilian models in order to gain greater speed and independence from prime movers.  Examples of this type of vehicle include high speed backhoes such as the Australian Army''s High Mobility Engineering Vehicle (HMEV) from Thales or the Canadian Army''s Multi-Purpose Engineer Vehicle (MPEV) from Arva.

Literature, visual arts, music, and scholarship have complex relationships with ideological forces.

==The 19th Century==
In the 19th century [[nationalism]] was an especially potent influence on all of these fields.  To summarize, every established national group used cultural productions to assert and strengthen a sense of national unity and destiny; less politically consolidated groups, especially those pursuing the goal of nationhood, used them in the same ways, though often with a note of determination that makes them easier to see from our contemporary point of reference.

Natural admiration for excellence and justifiable pride in a predecessor''s achievements is sometimes difficult to sort out from other intentions.  [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] was a great poet, the Societa Dantesca Italiana did great work in editing and publishing a usable and affordable text, but the ''''Divine Comedy'''' was certainly used by the newly unified Italian government (see [[History of Italy]]) to encourage a more homogeneous, Tuscan-influenced dialect for the whole peninsula (see [[Italian language]]).

===Visual Arts===

:[[Gothic revival]]

===Music===

===The Academy===
This relationship between ideology and serious work is particularly ambiguous in the academic fields of historical importance.  Much as 19th century science is often treated as the inventor of conceptions of evolution and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] which had serious negative political and social consequences, many 19th century historians pursued what they intended as reasonably objective research projects in the history of their own and other regions either to end by themselves using the results to support nationalistic goals or to see their work used that way by others. 

More politically consolidated nations sponsored historical research projects which produced results of permanent value - such as the ''''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'''' (')

In computing, ''''''multitasking'''''' is a method where multiple tasks, also known as [[Computer process|processes]], are performed during the same period of time. The tasks share common processing resources, such as a [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and main memory. In the case of a computer with a single CPU, only one task is said to be ''''running'''' at any point in time, meaning that the CPU is actively executing instructions for that task.
Multitasking solves the problem by [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] which task may be the one running at any given time, and when another waiting task gets a turn.  The act of reassigning a CPU from one task to another one is called a [[context switch]].
When context switches occur frequently enough the illusion of [[Parallel computing|parallelism]] is achieved.

In computing, a ''''''context switch'''''' is the process of storing and restoring the [[State (computer science)|state]] ([[Context (computing)|context]]) of a [[Process (computing)|process]] so that execution can be resumed from the same point at a later time. This enables multiple processes to share a single [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and is an essential feature of a [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] [[operating system]]. What constitutes the context is determined by the processor and the operating system.

Context switches are usually computationally intensive, and much of the design of operating systems is to optimize the use of context switches. Switching from one process to another requires a certain amount of time for doing the administration - saving and loading registers and memory maps, updating various tables and lists etc.

A context switch can mean a [[Processor register|register]] context switch, a [[Task (computing)|task]] context switch, a [[thread (computing)|thread]] context switch, or a process context switch.

== When to switch? ==
There are three potential triggers for a context switch:

=== Multitasking ===
Most commonly, within some [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] scheme, one process needs to be switched out of the CPU so another process can run.
This context switch can be triggered by the process making itself unrunnable, such as by waiting for an [[Input/output|I/O]] or [[Synchronization (computer science)|sync')

A ''''''cabal'''''' is a group of people united in some close design together, usually to promote their private views or interests in a [[Church body|church]], [[state (polity)|state]], or other community, often by [[Wiktionary:intrigue|intrigue]].  Cabals are sometimes [[secret societies]] composed of a few designing persons, and at other times are manifestations of [[emergence|emergent behavior]] in [[society]] or [[governance]] on the part of a community of persons who have well established public affiliation or kinship. The term can also be used to refer to the designs of such persons or to the practical consequences of their emergent behavior, and also holds a general meaning of intrigue and [[Conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]]. The use of this term usually  carries strong connotations of shadowy corners, back rooms and insidious influence; a cabal is more evil and selective than, say, a [[Political faction|faction]], which is simply selfish; because of this negative connotation, few organizations use the term to refer to themselves or their internal subdivisions.  Amongst the exceptions is [[Discordianism]], in which the term is used to refer to an identifiable group within the Discordian religion.

That Council of Chalcedon is the fourth of the [[first seven Ecumenical Councils]] accepted by the following [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Christian denominations]]: [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Catholic]], and many [[Protestant]] Christian churches.  It is the first Council ''''not'''' recognised by any of the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] churches who may be classifed as [[Non-Chalcedonianism|non-Chalcedonian]].

The [[dogmatic definition|Definition]] defines that Christ is ''acknowledged in two natures'', which ''come together into one person and hypostasis''. The formal definition of ''two natures'' in Christ was understood by the critics of the council at the time, and is understood by many historians and theologians today, to side with western and Antiochene [[Christology]] and to diverge from the teaching of [[Cyril of Alexandria]], who always stressed that Christ is ''one''. However, the best modern analysis of the sources of the creed (by A. de Halleux, in Revue Theologique de Louvain 7, 1976) and a reading of the acts, or proceedings, of the council (recently translated into English) show that the bishops considered Cyril the great authority and that even the language of ''two natures'' derives from him.

==Oriental Orthodox dissent==

The Chalcedonian creed was written amid controversy between the western and eastern churches over the meaning of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] (see [[Christology]]), the ecclesiastical influence of the [[Byzantine emperor|emperor]], and the supremacy of the Bishop of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]]. The western churches readily accepted the creed, but some eastern churches did not.

The type of fruit is given as a Drupe.  it cannot be a [[drupe ]].  Even by Wikipedia''s definition.  AS drupe has the seed inside a separate endocarp, (normally formed from the Ovary wall) with an auxilliary fruit formed around it.

The coffee fruit is surely a berry. Although some refer to ''coffee cherries'' they are not a cherry - which is a drupe from the rose family.

''''''Chuck-a-luck'''''', also known as ''''''birdcage'''''', is a [[gambling|game of chance]] played with three [[dice]]. It is derived from [[grand hazard]], and both can be considered a variant of [[sic bo]], a popular [[casino game]], although chuck-a-luck is more of a [[carnival game]] than a true casino game. The game is sometimes used as a fundraiser for [[Charitable organization|charity]].

==Rules==
Chuck-a-luck is played with three standard [[dice]] that are kept in a device shaped somewhat like an [[hourglass]] that resembles a wire-frame bird cage and that pivots about its centre. The dealer rotates the cage end over end, with the dice landing on the bottom.

Wagers are placed based on possible combinations that can appear on the three dice.  The possible wagers are usually fewer than the wagers that are possible in [[sic bo]] and, in that sense, chuck-a-luck can be considered to be a simpler game.

The wagers, and their associated odds, that are typically available are set out in the table below.

''''''''''Computer music'''''''''' is a term that was originally used within academia to describe a field of study relating to the applications of [[computing technology]] in [[musical composition|music composition]]; particularly that stemming from the [[Western art music]] tradition. It includes the theory and application of new and existing technologies in music, such as [[sound synthesis]], [[digital signal processing]], [[sound design]], sonic diffusion, [[acoustics]], and [[psychoacoustics]]. The field of computer music can trace its roots back to the origin of [[electronic music]], and the very first experiments and innovations with electronic instruments at the turn of the 20th century. More recently, with the advent of [[personal computing]], and the growth of [[home recording]], the term computer music is now sometimes used to describe any [[music]] that has been created using computing technology.

Much of the work on computer music has drawn on the relationship between [[music theory]] and [[mathematics]].
The world''s first computer to play music was [[CSIRAC]] which was designed and built by [[Trevor Pearcey]] and Maston Beard. Mathematician Geoff Hill programmed the CSIRAC to play popular musical melodies from the very early 1950s. In 1951 it publicly played the')

''''''Control engineering'''''' or ''''''control systems engineering'''''' is the [[engineering]] discipline that applies [[control theory]] to design systems with desired behaviors.  The practice uses [[sensors]] to measure the output performance of the device being controlled and those measurements can be used to give [[feedback]] to the input [[actuators]] that can make corrections toward desired performance. When a device is designed to perform without the need of human inputs for correction it is called [[automatic control]] (such as [[cruise control]] for regulating a car''s speed). Multi-disciplinary in nature, control systems engineering activities focus on implementation of control systems mainly derived by [[mathematical model]]ing of [[system]]s of a diverse range.

==Overview==
Modern day control engineering (also called control systems engineering) is a relatively new field of study that gained a significant attention during 20th century with the advancement in technology. It can be broadly defined or classified as practical application of [[control theory]]. Control engineering has an essential role in a wide range of control systems, from simple household washing machines to high-performance [[F-16]] fighter aircraft. It seeks to understand physical systems, using mathematical modeling, in terms of inputs, outputs and various components with different behaviors; use control systems design tools to develop [[Controller (control theory)|controller]]s for those systems; and implement controllers in physical systems employing available technology. A [[control system|system]] can be [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], [[fluid]], [[chemical]], [[finance|financial]] and even [[biology|biological]], and the mathematical modeling, analysis and controller design uses [[control theory]] in one or many of the [[Time domain|time]], [[frequency domain|frequency]] and [[S domain|complex-s]] domains, depending on the nature of the design problem.

== History ==

Automatic control Systems were first developed over two thousand years ago. The first feedback control device on record is thought to be the ancient [[Ktesibios]]''s [[water clock]] in [[Alexandria]], Egypt around the third century B.C. It kept time by regulating the water')

A ''''''cannon'''''' is any piece of [[artillery]] that uses [[gunpowder]] or other usually explosive-based propellants to launch a projectile. Cannon vary in [[caliber]], range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire, and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the battlefield. The word ''''cannon'''' is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as ''''tube'''', ''''cane'''', or ''''reed''''. The plural of ''''cannon'''' is also ''''cannon'''', though more commonly in America, ''''cannons''''. In the modern era, the term ''''cannon'''' has fallen out of common usage, replaced by')

''''''Civil defense'''''' (''''''civil defence''''''),  (see [[British and American English spelling differences|spelling differences]]) or ''''''civil protection'''''' is an effort to protect the citizens of a state (generally [[non-combatant]]s) from military attack. It uses the principles of [[emergency operation]]s: [[Hazard prevention|prevention]], [[#Mitigation|mitigation]], preparation, response, or [[emergency evacuation]], and recovery. Programmes of this sort were initially discussed at least as early as the 1920s and were implemented in many countries, but only became widespread after the threat of [[nuclear weapon]]s was realized.

Since the end of the [[Cold War]], the focus of civil defense has largely shifted from military attack to emergencies and disasters in general. The new concept is described by a number of terms, each of which has its own specific shade of meaning, such as ''''''[[crisis management]]'''''', ''''''[[emergency management]]'''''', ''''''emergency preparedness'''''', ''''''contingency planning'''''', ''''''emergency services'''''', and ''''''civil protection''''''.

In the [[United States]] a ''''''Community Emergency Response Team'''''' (''''''CERT'''''') can refer to
* one of five federal programs promoted under the umbrella organization [[Citizen Corps]], which is funded in part by the Stafford Act;
* an implementation of the federal CERT program, administered by a local sponsoring agency, which receives Stafford grant funding, and provides standardized training and an implementation framework to community members;
* an organization of [[volunteer]] emergency workers who have received specific training in basic disaster response skills, and who agree to supplement existing [[emergency responder]]s in the event of a major disaster.

Sometimes programs and organizations take different names, such as ''''''Neighborhood Emergency Response Team'''''' (''''''NERT''''''), or ''''''Neighborhood Emergency Team'''''' (''''''NET'''''').

The concept of civilian auxiliaries is similar to [[civil defense]], which has a longer history. The CERT concept differs because it includes nonmilitary emergencies, and is coordinated with all levels of emergency authorities, local to national, via an overarching [[incident command system]].')

The Islands are self-governing in free association with [[New Zealand]] and are fully responsible for internal affairs. New Zealand retains some responsibility for external affairs, in consultation with the Cook Islands. In recent years, the Cook Islands has taken on more of its own external affairs; as of 2005, it has diplomatic relations in its own name with eighteen other countries. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government, while [[legislative power]] is vested in both the government and [[Parliament of the Cook Islands|the islands'' parliament]].

When compared with Zebu bulls, Canchim bulls produce the same number of calves, but heavier and of superior quality. Compared to European breeds, the Canchim bull produces calves with the same weight but in larger numbers. The fast growing progeny, from crossbred zebu cows with Canchim bulls, can be slaughtered at 18 months old from feedlots after weaning, up to 24 months old from feedlots after grazing and at 30 months from grazing on the range.

==Origin==
Zebu cattle (Bos Indicus), introduced to Brazil in the last century, were extensively crossbred with herds of native cattle. The Indian breed, well known for its ability to survive in the tropics, adapted quickly to Brazil, and soon populated large areas, considerably improving Brazilian beef cattle breeding. Zebu cattle were however found to be inferior to the European breeds in growth rate and yield of meat. It became clear that the beef cattle population required genetic improvement. Simply placing European beef cattle (Bos Taurus), highly productive in [[temperate climates]], in Central Brazil, would not produce good results, due to their inability to adapt to a [[tropical]] environment. Besides the climate, other factors such as the high occurren')

==True origins?==
I''e always thought it originated with criminals, needing to conceal talking about their activities from listeners. It is particularly suited for this, because you can make up your own rhymes on the fly, even without saying the second part.  First, you use the rhyme once where the context is obvious.  The listener knows the sentence makes no sense, and therefore must be rhyming slang, and knowing what word should be there from the context, deduces the rhyme instantly.  It may then be used by either person when the meaning is no longer obvious from the context.

The ''''''Cushitic languages'''''' are a branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language family spoken in the [[Horn of Africa]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]]. They are named after the Biblical character [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]], who was traditionally identified as an ancestor of the speakers of these specific languages as early as AD 947 (in [[Masudi]]''s Arabic history ''''[[Meadows of Gold]]'''').  The most populous Cushitic language is [[Oromo language|Oromo]] with about 35 million speakers, followed by [[Somali language|Somali]] with about 18 million speakers, and [[Sidamo language|Sidamo]] in Ethiopia with about 2 million speakers. Other languages with more than one million speakers are [[Hadiyya language|Hadia]] (1.6 million), [[Kambaata language|Kambata]] (1.4 million), and [[Afar language|Afar]] (1.5 million).

==Composition==
There are six clearly valid groups of languages which are usually included in the Cushitic family ([[Beja language|Beja]], [[Agaw languages|Agaw]], [[Sidamic languages|Sidamic]], [[Lowland East Cushitic languages|Lowland East Cushitic]], [[Dullay languages|Dullay]], and [[South Cushitic languages|South Cushitic]]), as well as a few poorly classified languages ([[Yaaku language|Yaaku]], [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]], [[Asa language|Aasax]] and [[Kw''adza language|Kw''adza]], [[Boon language|Boon]], and the Cushitic element of [[Mbugu language|Mbugu]]).

These [[glycoside]]s are found as [[secondary metabolite]]s in several [[plant]]s, but also in some animals, such as the [[milkweed butterfly|milkweed butterflies]]. [[File:Oleandrin.svg|thumb|Example of the chemical structure of [[oleandrin]], one of the cardiac glycosides.]]

==Function==
Therapeutic uses of cardiac glycosides primarily involve the treatment of cardiac failure. Their utility results from an increased [[cardiac output]] by increasing the [[Inotrope|force of contraction]]. By increasing intracellular calcium as described below, cardiac glycosides increase [[calcium-induced calcium release]] and thus contraction. 

Drugs such as [[ouabain]] and [[digoxin]] are cardiac glycosides. [[Digoxin]] from the foxglove plant is used clinically, whereas [[ouabain]] is used only experimentally due to its extremely high potency.

Normally, [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium-potassium pumps]] in the membrane of cells (in this case, [[cardiac myocytes]]) pump potassium ions in and sodium ions out. Cardiac glycosides inhibit this pump by stabilizing it in the [[E2-P]] transition state, so that sodium cannot be extruded: intracellular sodium concentration therefore increases. A second membrane ion exchanger, [[Sodium-calcium exchanger|NCX]], is responsible for ''pumping'' calcium ions out of the cell and sodium ions in (3Na/Ca); raised intracellular sodium levels inhibit this pump, so calcium ions are not extruded and will also begin to build up inside the cell.

Increased cytoplasmic calcium concentrations cause increased calcium uptake into the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] via the SERCA2 transporter. Raised calcium stores in the SR allow for greater calcium release on stimulation, so the myocyte can achieve faster and more powerful contraction by cross-bridge cycling. The refractory period of the AV node is increased, so cardiac glycosides also function to regulate heart rate. 

Binding of cardiac glycoside to Na-K ATPase is slow, and also, after binding, intracellular calcium increases gradually. Thus, the action of [[Digoxin|digitalis]] (even on [[Intravenous|IV injection]]) is delayed.
 
Raised extracellular potassium decreases binding of cardiac glycoside to Na-K ATPase.  Consequently, increased toxicity of these drugs is observed in the presence of [[Hypokalemia]].

If SR calcium stores become too high, some ions are released spontaneously through SR [[ryanodine receptor]]s. This effect leads initially to [[bigeminy]]: regular [[ectopic beats]] fol')

''''''Conventional warfare'''''' is a form of [[war]]fare conducted by using conventional military weapons and battlefield tactics between two or more [[sovereign state|state]]s in open confrontation. The forces on each side are well-defined, and fight using weapons that primarily target the opposing army. It is normally fought using [[conventional weapon]]s, and not with [[chemical warfare|chemical]], [[biological warfare|biological]], or [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] weapons.

The general purpose of conventional warfare is to weaken or destroy the opponent''s military force, thereby negating its ability to engage in conventional warfare. In forcing capitulation, however, one or both sides may eventually resort to [[unconventional warfare]] tactics.

==Formation of the state==

{{details|State formation}}
The state was first advocated by [[Plato]], then found more acceptance in the consolidation of power under the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. European monarchs then gained power as the Catholic Church was stripped of temporal power and was replaced by the [[divine right of kings]]. In 1648, the powers of [[Europe]] signed the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] which ended the religious violence for purely political governance and outlook, signifying the birth of the modern ''state''.

Within this statist paradigm, only the state and its appointed representatives were allowed to bear [[weapon|arms]] and enter into war. In fact, war was only understood as a conflict between sovereign states. [[Monarch|King]]s strengthened this idea and gave it the force of [[law]]. Whereas previously any [[nobility|noble]] could start a war, the monarchs of Europe of necessity consolidated military power in response to the [[Napoleonic war]].

==The Clausewitzian paradigm==

[[Prussia]] was one country attempting to amass military power. [[Carl von Clausewitz]], one of Prussia''s officers, wrote ''''[[On War]]'''', a work rooted solely in the world of the state.')

Calvinism teaches that God predestines people to heaven, and allows the rest to suffer the consequences of their sin. This is not the same as what you''re describing, that is called double-predestination, which is a subclass of Calvinist thought (and the minority).

God brings about repentance in the elect by changing their will in such a way that they will turn to him, which no one would do otherwise. So those who are not predestined to heaven would never pray and ask for repentance because without God''s changing of their will they would never desire that. So if someone prays and asks for forgiveness it means that their will')

What this article requires is genuine care by those who have a genuine interest in the subject and particularly by those who have a significant interest in the person of Jesus Himself.  The reality is that there are many divergent views and even those who outwardly maintain the majority view have really little idea of the issues are.  Therefore, the focus must be an inclusive discussion so that the issues are clearly laid out and well understood.  While I find the majority view defective, I am not in the least interested in any way in misrepresenting but would rather represent it as accurately and completely as possible.  Frankly, it is only in this light that the actual defects can be manifest.

Secondly, the history is what it is.  The earliest history is, of course, shrouded in a fog other than the extant NT texts which are what much of the controversy is about.  Regardless, there are many pieces and there is no reason that we cannot assemble an realtively agreed upon history.

In legal terminology, a ''''''complaint'''''' is any formal legal document that sets out the facts and legal reasons (see: [[cause of action]]) that the [[Filing (legal)|filing]] party or parties (the [[plaintiff]](s)) believes are sufficient to support a claim against the party or parties against whom the claim is brought (the [[defendant]](s)) that entitles the plaintiff(s) to a [[Legal remedy|remedy]] (either [[money damages]] or [[injunctive relief]])]).  For example, the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] (FRCP) that govern civil litigation in [[United States]] courts provide that a civil action is commenced with the filing or service of a pleading called a complaint. Civil court rules in states that have incorporated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure use the same term for the same pleading.

In some jurisdictions, specific types of criminal cases may also be commenced by the filing of a complaint, also sometimes called a ''''''criminal complaint'''''' or ''''''felony complaint''''''.

== Response on history ==

Prior to the Council of Trent in the 16th century, it was not uncommon to publicly celebrate marriages on church steps. Moreover, marriage was believed to be a sacrament even if celebrated privately, without any witnesses. (Just as baptism is a sacrament even when it is performed privately by one layman on another layman.) The Council of Trent, in order to emphasize the sacramental nature of marriage, required that a valid marriage should involve a cleric and two witnesses (except, I assume, in cases of necessity, like desert isles, and so on).

There was no opposition to marriage, since marriage was always seen as an image of the love between Christ and the Church, but celibacy for the sake of the Kingdom of God has always been touted as even better than marriage.

''''''Computer security '''''' is [[information security]] as applied to [[computer]]s and networks.

The field covers all the processes and mechanisms by which computer-based equipment, information and services are protected from unintended or unauthorized access, change or destruction. Computer security also includes protection from unplanned events and natural disasters.

== Security by design ==
{{Main|Security by design}}

One way to think of computer security is to reflect security as one of the main features 

Some of the techniques in this approach include:
* The [[principle of least privilege]], where each part of the system has only the privileges that are needed for its function. That way even if an [[attacker]] gains access to that part, they have only limited access to the whole system.
* [[Automated theorem proving]] to prove the correctness of crucial software subsystems.
* [[Code review]]s and [[unit testing]] are approaches to make modules more secure where formal correctness proofs are not possible.
* [[Defense in depth (computing)|Defense in depth]], where the design is such that more than one subsystem needs to be violated to compromise the integrity of the system and the information it holds.
* Default secure settings, and design to')

==Problems==

I think this article could be improved: There is no mention how computer security relates to computer safety. In particular, some definitions of computer security require the presence of an attacker, otherwise a random disk failure is also considered a security issue - sometimes it is, but more conventionally it would be an issue of reliability. And in a nuclear powerplant or aircraft it would be an issue of computer saftey. It would be a good idea if this article expands on these differences.

''''''Chemotaxis'''''' is the phenomenon whereby [[somatic cells]], [[bacteria]], and other [[single-cell]] or [[multicellular]] organisms direct their movements according to certain chemicals in their environment. This is important for bacteria to find food (for example, [[glucose]]) by swimming towards the highest concentration of food molecules, or to flee from [[poison]]s (for example, [[phenol]]). In multicellular organisms, chemotaxis is critical to early development (e.g. movement of [[sperm]] towards the egg during [[fertilization]]) and subsequent phases of development (e.g. migration of [[neuron]]s or [[lymphocyte]]s) as well as in normal function. In addition, it has been recognized that mechanisms that allow chemotaxis in animals can be subverted during [[cancer]] [[metastasis]].

''''Positive'''' chemotaxis occurs if the movement is toward a higher concentration of the chemical in question. Conversely, ''''negative'''' chemotaxis occurs if the movement is in the opposite direction.

:Roughly speaking, the terms of the sequence are getting closer and closer together in a way that suggests that the sequence ought to converge. Nonetheless, Cauchy sequences do not always converge.

I''d like to put something along the following lines: Cauchy Seqs are initially useful in spaces such as the Reals because they are a test of convergence which doesn''t require a value for the potential limit. -- the flip side is that IF all CSs converge then a space is complete.

There''s a sort of switch in perception as things move up a level of abstraction which as a mathematician I find self-evident (and in')

There exist laws restricting or regulating [[circumcision]], some dating back to ancient times.  In a number of modern states, circumcision is presumed to be legal, but under certain circumstances, more general laws, such as laws about assault or child custody, may sometimes be interpreted as applying to situations involving circumcision.  Some countries have placed restrictions on circumcision.

==History==
{{See also|Brit milah}}
There are ancient religious requirements for [[circumcision]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] commands [[Jew]]s to circumcise their male children on the eighth day of life, and to circumcise their male slaves ({{bibleverse||Genesis|17:11-12|HE}}).

Laws banning circumcision are also ancient. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] prized the foreskin and disapproved of the Jewish custom of circumcision.')

''''''Called to Common Mission'''''' is an agreement between [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|The Episcopal Church]] and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA), establishing full communion between them. It was ratified by the ELCA in 1999, the ECUSA in 2000, after the narrow failure of a previous agreement. Its principal author on the Episcopal side was the Rev. Canon [[J. Robert Wright]].  Under the agreement, they recognize the validity of each other''s [[baptism]]s and [[ordination]]s. The agreement provided that the ELCA would accept the [[historical episcopate]], something which became controversial in the ELCA. In response to concerns about the meaning of CCM, bishops in the ELCA drafted [http://www.elca.org/synods/bishopstucson.html Tucson Resolution], which presented the official ELCA position.

Some  within the ELCA argued that requiring the historic episcopate would contradict the traditional [[Lutheran doctrine]] that the church exists wherever the Word is preached and Sacraments are practiced. Others objected on the grounds that adopting the Episcopalian priesthood and  hierarchical structure was contrary to the Lutheran concept of the [[priesthood of all believers]], which holds that all Christians stand on equal footing before God. They argued that the [[Old Covenant]] required a priest to mediate between God and humanity, but that [[New Covenant]] explicitly abolishes the need for priestly role by making every Christian a priest with direct access to God''s grace. Still others objected because of the implied directive that [[lay presidency]] would be abolished. This was a particularly issue for rural congregations that periodically')

[[Image:Context menu.png|frame|right|A desktop context menu in [[GNOME]] which can be customized]]

[[Image:Context menu windows.png|thumb|233px|right|Context menus in [[Windows 8]] are customizable by third-party software.]]

A ''''''context menu'''''' (also called ''''''contextual'''''', ''''''shortcut'''''', and ''''''popup'''''' or ''''''pop-up'''''' ''''''menu'''''') is a [[Menu (computing)|menu]] in a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) that appears upon user interaction, such as a right-click [[Mouse (computing)#Operation|mouse operation]]. A context menu offers a limited set of choices that are available in the current state, or context, of the operating system or application. Usually the available choices are actions related to the [[Selection (user interface)|selected object]].

==History==
Context menus first appeared in the [[Smalltalk]] environment on the [[Xerox Alto]] computer, where they were called ''''pop-up menus.'''' The [[NEXTSTEP]] operating system further developed the idea, incorporating a feature whereby the right or middle mouse button brought the main menu (which was vertical and automatically changed depending on context) to the location of the mouse, thereby eliminating the need to move the mouse pointer all the way across the large (for the time) NextStep screen.

==Implementation==
Context menus are opened via various forms of user interaction that target a region of the GUI that supports context menus. The specific form of user interaction and the means by which a region is targeted vary:
* On a computer running [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], or [[Unix]] running the [[X Window System]], clicking the secondary mouse button (usually the right button) opens a context menu for the region that is under the mouse pointer.
* On systems that support one-button mice, context menus are typically opened by pressing and holding the primary mouse button (this works on the icons in the Dock on [[Mac OS X]]) or by pressing a keyboard/mouse button combination (e.g. Ctrl-mouse click in [[Mac OS]]). A keyboard alternative for Mac OS is to enable [[Mouse keys]] in [[Universal Access]]. Then, depending on whether a laptop or compact or extended keyboard type is used, the shortcut is {{keypress|Function}}+{{keypress|Ctrl}}+5 or {{keypress|Ctrl}}+5 (numeric keypad) or {{keypress|Function}}+{{keypress|Ctrl}}+i (laptop).
* In Microsoft Windows, pressing the [[Menu key|Application key]] or Shift+F10 opens a context menu for the region that has [[Focus (computing)|focus]].

Context menus are sometimes hierarchically organized, allowing navigation through different levels of the menu structure. The implementations differ: [[Microsoft Word]] was one of the first applications to only show sub-entries of some menu entries after clicking an arrow icon on the context menu, otherwise executing an action associated with the parent entry. This makes it possible to quickly repeat an action with the parameters of the previous execution, and to better separate options from actions.

=== X Window Managers ===

The following [[window manager]]s provide context menu functionality:

* [[9wm]]
* [[IceWM]] - [[middleclick]] and [[rightclick]] context menus on [[Desktop environment|desktop]], [[menubar]]. [[titlebar]]s, and [[titleicon]]
* [[olwm]]
* [[openbox]]
* [[Sawfish (window manager)|sawfish]]

==Usability==
Context menus have received some criticism from [[usability]] analysts when improperly used, as some applications make certain features ''''only'''' available in context menus, which may confuse even experienced users (especially when the context menus can only be')

''''''Collation'''''' is the assembly of written information into a standard order. Many systems of collation are based on [[number|numerical order]] or [[alphabetical order]], or extensions and combinations thereof. Collation is a fundamental element of most office [[File system|filing systems]], [[library catalog]]s and [[reference book]]s.

Collation differs from ''''[[Document classification|classification]]'''' in that classification is concerned with arranging information into logical categories, while collation is concerned with the ordering of items of information, usually based on the form of their [[identifier]]s. Formally speaking, a collation method typically defines a [[total order]] on a set of possible identifiers, called [[sort key]]s, which consequently produces a [[total preorder]] on the set of items of information (items with the same identifier are not placed in any defined order).

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |History}}

[[Christianity]] is rooted in [[Second Temple Judaism]], but the two religions [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|diverged in the first centuries]] of the [[Christian Era]]. Since the [[Ecumenical Councils]], with the first held in 325, [[Christendom]] places emphasis on [[orthodoxy|correct belief (or ''''orthodoxy'''')]], focusing on the [[New Covenant]] that the [[God in Christianity|Christian Triune God]] made through [[Jesus Christ]], as recorded in the [[New Testament]]. Judaism places emphasis on the [[Orthopraxy#Judaism|right conduct (or ''''orthopraxy'''')]], focusing on the [[Mosaic Covenant]] that the [[God in Judaism|God of Israel]] made with the [[Israelites]], as recorded in the [[Torah]] and [[Talmud]].

[[Christians]] obtain [[individual salvation]] from [[Christian views on sin|sin]] through [[Repentance (theology)|repentance of sin]] and receiving Jesus Christ as their God and [[Redeemer (Christianity)|Savior]] through [[Faith in Christianity|faith and grace]]. [[Jews]] individually and collectively participate in an eternal dialogue with God through tradition, rituals, [[Jewish prayer|prayers]] and [[Jewish ethics|ethical actions]]. Christianity worships a [[Trinity|Triune God]], one person of whom is also [[Hypostatic union|human]]. Judaism emphasizes the [[Shema|Oneness of God]] and rejects the Christian concept of [[God the Son|God in human form]].

==Self-identification==
Judaism''s purpose is to carry out what it holds to be the only [[Covenant (biblical)#Mosaic covenant|Covenant]] between [[God in Judaism|God]] and the [[Jewish people]]. The Torah (lit.')

In [[mathematics]] and, in particular, [[functional analysis]], ''''''convolution'''''' is a [[operation (mathematics)|mathematical operation]] on two [[function (mathematics)|function]]s ''''f'''' and ''''g'''', producing a third function that is typically viewed as a modified version of one of the original functions, giving the area overlap between the two functions as a function of the amount that one of the original functions is [[Translation (geometry)|translated]].  Convolution is similar to [[cross-correlation]].  It has applications that include [[probability]], [[statistics]], [[computer vision]], [[image processing|image]] and [[signal processing]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[differential equations]].

The convolution can be defined for functions on [[group (mathematics)|groups]] other than [[Euclidean space]].  For example, [[periodic function]]s, such as the [[discrete-time Fourier transform]], can be defined on a [[circle]] and convolved by ''''periodic convolution''''.

Originally from the city of [[Kozhikode]] (known by Europeans as ''''Calicut'''' in the 11th century) in [[Kerala]], [[India]]. The fabric was made by the traditional weavers called [[chaliyan]]s.

A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps.

A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical [[models of computation]] to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other complexity measures are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in [[communication complexity]]), the number of [[logic gate|gates]] in a circuit (used in [[circuit complexity]]) and the number of processors (used in [[parallel computing]]). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what [[computer]]s can and cannot do.

Yep, in the technical usage of the Roman CAtholic church a ''''''cross'''''' is a cross, while a ''''''crucifix'''''' has a ''''corpus'''' (Latin, ''body'') fixed to it.  The entry needs to be disambiguated. --MichaelTinkler.

: Have you noticed that [[:Cross|Cross]] has a link to [[:Christian cross|Christian cross]], which redirects to this article? There should probably be some actual text at the Christian cross article, instead of redirecting straight here. I didn''t set up the redirects, but I''ve been wondering when someone would notice and object. Guess that would be me now....  --[[User:Wesley|Wesley]]

Just out of curiousity, if someone wants to make their own crucifix is there any place where a corpus may be obtained?  I ask because I had a hard time finding one when I went to make a crucifix last year, only one store had one and it was about three feet tall and was several hundred dollars.  I couldn''t find any on the internet either in the size or cost range I wanted.  I wound up carving the corpus myself - easier said than done because at the time I had very little experience carving stuff.')

:How do you photograph a force?  Also, remember that it is only significant at submicron lengthscales which requires fairly delicate experiments.

:One can certainly find photographs of the experimental apparatuses that are used to measure the force, and plots of measured data.  e.g. you can find some such pictures in [http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v5/n4/full/nphoton.2011.39.html this review article].  However, we can''t just copy pictures from papers into Wikipedia because of copyright reasons.  We might be able to contact one of the experimental groups (e.g. [http://www.yale.edu/lamoreauxgroup Steve Lamoreaux''s group] is an obvious candidate) to see if they will donate a picture of their apparatus.  I''m not sure how illuminating this kind of apparatus picture will be for readers of the article, though.

An ''''''electronic calculator'''''' is a small, portable, often inexpensive electronic device used to perform both basic and complex operations of [[arithmetic]].

The first [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid state]] electronic calculator was created in the 1960s, building on the extensive history of tools such as the abacus, developed around 2000 BC; and the [[mechanical calculator]], developed in the 17th century. It was developed in parallel with the [[analog computer]]s of the day.

Pocket sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the [[Intel 4004|invention of the microprocessor]] developed by [[Intel]] for the Japanese calculator company [[Busicom]].

Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers.  They became popular in the mid-1970s as [[integrated circuit]]s made their size and cost small.  By the end of that decade, calculator prices had reduced to a point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.

Computer operating systems as far back as [[Ancient UNIX Systems|early Unix]] have included interactive calculator programs such as [[dc (Unix)|dc]] and [[hoc (programming language)|hoc]], and calculator functions are included in almost all [[Personal digital assistant|PDA-type]] devices (save a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices).

{{Alternative Dispute Resolution}}

''''''Conciliation'''''' is an [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR) process whereby the parties to a dispute use a conciliator, who meets with the parties separately in an attempt to resolve their differences. They do this by lowering tensions, improving communications, interpreting issues, providing technical assistance, exploring potential solutions and bringing about a negotiated settlement.

Conciliation differs from [[arbitration]] in that the conciliation process, in and of itself, has no legal standing, and the conciliator usually has no authority to seek evidence or call witnesses, usually writes no decision, and makes no award.

Conciliation differs from [[mediation]] in that the main goal is to conciliate, most of the time by seeking concessions. In mediation, the mediator tries to guide the discussion in a way that optimizes parties needs, takes feelings into account and reframes representations.

In conciliation the parties seldom, if ever, actually face each other across the table in the presence of the conciliator.

==Effectiveness==
Recent studies in the processes of [[negotiation]] have indicated the effectiveness of a technique that deserves mention here. A conciliator assists each of the parties to independently develop a list of all of their objectives (the outcomes which they desire to obtain from the conciliation). The conciliator then has each of the parties separately prioritize their own list from most to least important. He/She then goes back and forth between the parties and encourages them to')

Originally, computer monitors were used for [[data processing]] while [[television receiver]]s were used for entertainment. From the 1980s onwards, computers (and their monitors) have been used for both data processing and entertainment, while televisions have implemented some computer functionality.

Chuck -

There''s quite a bit of evidence, but it''s very difficult to set up scientifically controlled experiments with people as subjects. The case is often overstated.

There is a booklet available in which the various experiments are reviewed - I haven''t just got a copy to hand, and I can''t just rememember the title :-). Ah - I''ve just found a reference to it:

In its basic form, the Chinese remainder theorem will determine a number ''''n'''' that when divided by some given divisors leaves given remainders. 

For example, what is the lowest number ''''n'''' that when divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, when divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 3, and when divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 2? A common introductory example is a woman who tells a policeman that she lost her basket of eggs, and that if she took three at a time out of it, she was left with 2, if she took five at a time out of it she was left with 3, and if she took seven at a time out of it she was left with 2. She then asks the policeman what is the minimum number of eggs she must have had. The answer to both problems is 23.

[[Image:Abraham-Lincoln-battlegroup.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The USS ''''Abraham Lincoln'''' battle group during the 2000 [[RIMPAC]] exercises]]
A ''''''carrier battle group'''''' (''''''CVBG'''''') consists of an [[aircraft carrier]] (designated CV) and its escorts, together comprising the group. The first naval task forces built around carriers appeared just prior to and during World War II. The Imperial Japanese Navy was the first to assemble a large number of carriers into a single task force, known as [[Kido Butai]]. This task force was used with devastating effect during the [[Pearl Harbor Attack]]. [[Kido Butai]] operated as the IJN''s main carrier battle group until four of its carriers were sunk at the [[Battle of Midway]]. In contrast, the United States Navy deployed its large carriers in separate formations, with each carrier assigned its own cruiser and destroyer escorts. These single-carrier formations would often be paired or grouped together for certain assignments, most notably the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] and Midway. By 1943 however, large numbers of fleet and light carriers became available, which required larger formations of three or four carriers. These carrier groups eventually formed the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]], which became the primary battle force of the U.S. Fifth and Third Fleets.

With the construction of the large supercarriers of the Cold War era, the practice of operating each carrier in a single formation was revived. During the [[Cold War]], the main role of the CVBG in case of conflict with the [[Soviet Union]] would have been to protect Atlantic supply routes between the United States and Europe, while the role of the [[Soviet Navy]] would have been to interrupt these sea lanes, a fundamentally easier task. Because the Soviet Union had no large carriers of its own, a situation of dueling aircraft carriers would have been unlikely. However, a primary mission of the Soviet Navy''s [[attack submarine]]s was to shadow every CVBG and, on the outbreak of hostilities, sink the carriers. Understanding this threat, the CVBG expended enormous resources in its own [[anti-submarine warfare]] mission.

The ''''''Chief of Naval Operations'''''' (''''''CNO'''''') is a statutory office ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|5033}}) held by a four-star admiral in the [[United States Navy]], and is the most senior naval officer assigned to serve in the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]]. The office is a military adviser and deputy to the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]]. In a separate capacity as a member of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|151}}) the CNO is a military adviser to the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], the [[United States Homeland Security Council|Homeland Security Council]], the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], and the [[President of the United States|President]]. The Chief of Naval Operations is typically the highest-ranking officer on [[active-duty]] in the U.S. Navy unless the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chairman]] and/or the [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] are naval officers. 

The Chief of Naval Operations is an administrative position based in [[the Pentagon]], and while the CNO ''''does not have operational command authority'''' over Naval forces as the title implies (that is nowadays within the purview of the [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commanders]] who report to the Secretary of Defense), the CNO ''''does exercise supervision'''' of Navy organizations as the designee of the Secretary of the Navy.

The current Chief of Naval Operations is Admiral [[Jonathan W. Greenert]].

{{wiktionary}}
A ''''''crossfire'''''' (also known as ''''''interlocking fire'''''') is a military term for the siting of weapons (often [[automatic weapon]]s such as [[assault rifle]]s or [[sub-machine gun]]s) so that their arcs of fire overlap. This tactic came to prominence in [[World War I]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Siting weapons this way is an example of the application of the defensive principle of ''''mutual support''''. The advantage of siting weapons that mutually support one another is that it is difficult for an attacker to find a covered approach to any one defensive position.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  

Use of armour, air support, indirect fire support, and stealth are tactics that may be used to assault a defensive position. However when combined with [[land mine]]s, [[sniper]]s, [[barbed wire]], and air cover, crossfire became a difficult tactic to counter in the early 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

''''''Clicks'''''' are speech sounds that occur as [[consonants]] in many languages of southern Africa, and in three languages of East Africa.  Examples of these sounds familiar to English speakers are the [[dental click|''''tsk! tsk!'''']] (American spelling) or ''''tut-tut'''' (British spelling) used to express disapproval or pity, the [[lateral click|''''tchick!'''']] used to spur on a horse, and the [[alveolar click|''''clip-clop!'''']] sound children make with their tongue to imitate a horse trotting.

Technically, clicks are [[obstruent]]s articulated with two closures (points of contact) in the mouth, one forward and one at the back. The pocket of air enclosed between is [[rarefaction|rarefied]] by a sucking action of the tongue (in technical terminology, clicks have a [[Airstream mechanism|lingual ingressive airstream mechanism]]). The forward closure is then released, producing what may be the loudest consonants in the language, although in some languages such as [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], clicks can be more subtle and may even be mistaken for [[ejective consonant|ejectives]].

==What clicks sound like==
{{IPA chart non-pulmonic consonants with audio}}

Click consonants occur at five principal places of articulation. [[IPA]] represents a click by placing the assigned symbol for the place of click articulation adjacent to a symbol for a non-click sound at the rear place of articulation. The IPA symbols are used in writing most Khoisan languages, but Bantu languages such as Zulu typically use Latin c, x and q for dental, lateral, and alveolar clicks respectively.

A ''''''consumer'''''' is a person or group of people who are the final users of products and or services generated within a social system.  A consumer may be a person or group, such as a [[household]].  The concept of a consumer may vary significantly by context, although a common definition is an individual who buys products or services for personal use and not for manufacture or resale.

==Economics and marketing==
The consumer is the one who pays to consume the goods and services produced. As such, consumers play a vital role in the economic system of a nation. In the absence of effective consumer demand, producers would lack one of the key motivations to produce: to sell to consumers.
 
Typically, when [[business]] people and economists talk of ''''consumers'''', they are talking about ''''the person as consumer'''', an aggregated [[commodity]] item with little [[individuality]] other than that expressed in the decision to buy or not to buy. However, there is a trend in [[marketing]] to individualize the concept. Instead of generating broad [[demographic profile]]s and [[Psychographic|psycho-graphic profiles]] of [[market segment]]s, marketers have started to engage in [[personalized marketing]], [[permission marketing]], and [[mass customization]].')

A ''''''chain reaction'''''' is a sequence of reactions where a reactive product or by-product causes additional reactions to take place. In a chain reaction, [[positive feedback]] leads to a self-amplifying [[chain of events]].

Chain reactions are one way in which systems which are in thermodynamic non-equilibrium can release energy or increase entropy in order to reach a state of higher entropy. For example, a system may not be able to reach a lower energy state by releasing energy into the environment, because it is hindered in some way from taking the path that will result in the energy release. If a reaction results in a small energy release making way for more energy releases in an expanding chain, then the system will typically collapse explosively until much or all of the stored energy has been released. Since chain reactions result in [[energy transformation]] into forms associated with larger amounts of [[entropy]]. In accordance with the [[laws of thermodynamics]], the reactions cannot be reversed.

Hmmm.  Where did the 4-7 million years come from?  Best guesses I''d read (though they were a decade ago) were ~10 million at least. --[[User:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]]

Is there really no reason to differentiate hominids and the apes? I think that humans, and our ancestors, designate a distinct break from the apes. --[[User:James|James]]

Agreed that chimpanzees are hominids, but putting them in Homo seems questionable: it would require reclassifying all human ancestors back to the human/chimp split as Homo (instead of Australopithecus, etc.). Part of the problem is that we don''t yet have a clear family tree for H. sapiens; another part is that few if any fossils of chimpanzee ancestors have been found. --[[User:Vicki Rosenzweig|Vicki Rosenzweig]]

Robert, I can give you three relatively recent references:Jared Diamond (1992) speaks of 6-8 million years; Frans de Waal (1997) proposes a split off at 6 million years; Juan Luis Arsuaga, from the Atapuerca research group (1998) suggests between 4.5 and 7 million years. The gap has been getting smaller in recent years, as you can see.
James, are you sure you can say objectively that humans are a distinct break from apes? technologically we''ve gone a long way of course, but biologically (and classifying species is after all about biology) the differences aren''t that great.
Vicki, you''''re absolutely right as to the difficulties involving a reclassification, but I''m not quite sure about the sentence you introduced referring to chimpanzees forming longer-lasting relationships than bonobos. Basically, bonobos use sex in different ways than chimpanzees, and more extensively.

As I said, I''m planning to expand on this article. In any case, I wanted to catch people''s attention with my introduction and I think I''ve managed. -Calypso

In [[computing]], a ''''''data warehouse'''''' or ''''''enterprise data warehouse'''''' (''''''DW'''''', ''''''DWH'''''', or ''''''EDW'''''') is a [[database]] used for [[Business reporting|reporting]] and [[data analysis]]. It is a central repository of data which is created by integrating data from one or more disparate sources. Data warehouses store current as well as historical data and are used for creating trending reports for senior management reporting such as annual and quarterly comparisons.

The data stored in the warehouse are [[Uploading and downloading|uploaded]] from the operational systems (such as marketing, sales etc., shown in the figure to the right). The data may pass through an [[operational data store]] for additional operations before they are used in the DW for reporting.

The typical [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]]-based data warehouse uses [[Staging (data)|staging]], data integration, and access layers to house its key functions. The staging layer or staging database stores raw data extracted from each of the disparate source data systems. The integration layer integrates the disparate data sets by transforming the data from the staging layer often storing this transformed data in an [[operational data store]] (ODS) database. The integrated data are then moved to yet another database, often called the data warehouse database, where the data is arranged into hierarchical groups often called dimensions and into facts and aggregate facts. The combination of facts and dimensions is sometimes called a [[star schema]].  The access layer helps users retrieve data.')

''''''Alcohol intoxication'''''' (also known as ''''''drunkenness'''''' or ''''''inebriation'''''') is a physiological state induced by the consumption of [[Ethanol|alcohol]]. 

Intoxication is the consequence of alcohol entering the [[Blood alcohol content|bloodstream]] faster than it can be metabolized by the [[liver]]. Some effects of alcohol intoxication are central to alcohol''s desirability [[alcoholic beverage|as a beverage]] and its history as the world''s most widespread [[recreational drug]]. Common effects are [[euphoria]] and lowered [[social inhibition]]s. Other effects are unpleasant or dangerous because alcohol affects many different areas of the body at once and may cause progressive, long-term harm when consumed in excess.

Common [[symptom]]s of alcohol intoxication include slurred speech, euphoria, impaired balance, loss of muscle coordination ([[ataxia]]), flushed face, dehydration, vomiting, reddened eyes, [[disinhibition|reduced inhibitions]], and erratic behavior. Sufficiently high levels of blood-borne alcohol will cause [[coma]] and death from the depressive effects of alcohol upon the [[central nervous system]].')

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is by the Congo River Basin, which covers an area of almost {{convert|1000000|km2}}. The country''s only outlet to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] is a narrow strip of land on the north bank of the Congo River.

The vast, low-lying central area is a basin-shaped plateau sloping toward the west, covered by [[tropical rainforest]] and criss-crossed by rivers, a large area of this has been categorized by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as the [[Central Congolian lowland forests]] [[ecoregion]]. The forest center is surrounded by mountainous terraces in the west, plateaus merging into savannas in the south and southwest, and dense grasslands extending beyond the Congo River in the north. High mountains of the [[Ruwenzori Range]] (some above {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are found on the eastern borders with [[Rwanda]] and [[Uganda]] (see [[Albertine Rift montane forests]] for a description of this area).

== Climate ==
The Democratic Republic of the Congo lies on the [[Equator]], with one-third of the country to the north and two-thirds to the south. The climate is hot and humid in the river basin and cool and dry in the southern highlands, with a cold, alpine climate in the [[Ruwenzori Range]]. South of the Equator, the rainy season lasts from October to May and north of the Equator, from April to November. Along the Equator, rainfall is fairly regular throughout the year. During the wet season, thunderstorms often are violent but seldom last more than a few hours. The average rainfall for the entire country is about {{convert|1070|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

In antiquity, the territory was part of the [[Land of Punt]]. The Djibouti area, along with other localities in the Horn region, was later the seat of the medieval [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]] and [[Ifat Sultanate|Ifat]] Sultanates. In the late 19th century, the colony of [[French Somaliland]] was established following treaties signed by the ruling [[Issa (clan)|Issa Somali]] and [[Afar people|Afar]] Sultans with the French. It was subsequently renamed to the [[French Territory of the Afars and the Issas]] in 1967. A decade later, the Djiboutian people voted for independence, officially marking the establishment of the Republic of Djibouti.

Like its [[Eastern Caribbean]] neighbors, the main priority of [[Dominica]]''s foreign relations is economic development. The country maintains missions in Washington, New York, London, and Brussels and is represented jointly with other [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS) members in [[Canada]]. Dominica is also a member of the [[Caribbean Development Bank]] (CDB), and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It became a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) in 1978 and of the [[World Bank]] and [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) in 1979.

As a member of [[CARICOM]], in July 1994 Dominica strongly backed efforts by the United States to implement [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 940]], designed to facilitate the departure of [[Haiti]]''s de facto authorities from power. The country agreed to contribute personnel to the multinational force, which restored the democratically elected government of Haiti in October 1994.

lets say we got a binary string with totally N bits from witch p% are bits of 1 , (100-p)% bits of 0. We might use for an avalanche compressing data an XOR bit by bit with a N bits string that have 1.2*p% bits of 1... etc obtaining 0.75*p bits of 1 N resulted string... applyable also 4 optimizing performing muls or other functions using a small base of preresolved cases ...

''''''Detective fiction'''''' is a sub-genre of [[crime fiction]] and [[mystery fiction]] in which an [[criminal investigation|investigator]] or a [[detective]] - either professional or amateur - investigates a crime, often [[murder]].

==Beginnings of detective fiction==

===In ancient literature===
Some scholars{{who|date=November 2010}} have suggested that certain ancient and religious texts bear similarities to what would later be called detective fiction. In the Old Testament story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel: 13)|Susanna and the Elders]] (the [[Protestant]] [[Bible]] locates this story within the [[apocrypha]]), the account told by two witnesses breaks down when [[Daniel]] cross-examines them. The author [[Julian Symons]] has commented on writers who see this as a detective story, arguing that')

==Poll/request for feedback==

I''ve listed this article because I am stumped about an essential feature of the article/list: I am not sure how to define the discovery date. Here are some cases I have stumped onto (I am talking mostly about the ''''''Recorded discoveries'''''' section):
:1) many early elements are noticed/discovered by someone, but there is not a good definition of chemical element available to label as such; also, there was no academic community to accept these discoveries;
:2) many elements were discovered by someone but they did not care enough to advertize their discoveries (i.e. palladium) or simply did not get to publish it fast enough; meanwhile others have published similar discoveries, and not in every case the latter recognized the discovery of the first person;
:3) some elements were discovered obscurely but never got any attention; nevertheless, scientific assesments suggest veridicity of results (I cannot think of a better example right now, but technetium is a good example);
:4) some rare elements were discovered, but I am not sure they were actually truly isolated; for example some rare earths wewre probably isolated in small quantities, but there might be no report besides the initial discovery (heaviest radioactive elements fall in this category also)
:5) some elements were almost surely known to exist before they were isolated; for example F isolation from HF had been attempted for a very long time before it was actually done; is isolation=discovery in this case?
:6) some elements were prepared very impure; later, others got the credit for doing the separation the same way, but at higher purity (i.e. silicon); who is the winner?
:7) ''''more to be added! I don''t care about MOS or text yet. I just want to know what should I use as a principal date.''''

==More space==
This topic obviously deserves a ''''lot'''' more space than this, preferably by someone who actually knows something about the topic of how music has been defined. (I''m not such a person, myself.) --[[User:LMS|LMS]]
-----------
==Organized sound==
The definition originally put in this page (that music is sound organized in time) is the definition drilled into music majors at the University of North Carolina, Asheville. It covers all genre of music, and doesn''t get caught up in issues of rhythm, melody, harmony, timbre, and form (which would be more appropriately discussed in detail within the music theory page). The only modification I made to the original definition drilled into us is that music is a form of art; therefore, you wouldn''t say ''this radio program is music'', as it isn''t expressive.

It''s important to avoid getting caught up in a definition of music that would involve rhythm, melody, harmony, timbre, or form because not all works of music use all of these elements. For example, many modern pieces lack rhythm, and many ancient works lack harmony. But it might be nice to mention these elements within a page defining music, if for no other reason than to point out that a proper definition of music could not include them.

Hmm... rhythm, melody, harmony, timbre, and form should perhaps be mentioned in the page concerning music theory.

In any event, any definition for music beyond what was originally entered would prick my interest tremendously, as I''d love to find something better to throw at my old college professors.

Many thanks go to the gentleman who corrected my reference to 4:11 as Four Minutes, Thirty Three Seconds. I felt it important to mention that composition when giving the prior definition, because it does openly challenge the definition. Unfortunately, I couldn''t quite remember the title correctly')

''''''Dominoes'''''' (or ''''''dominos'''''') generally refers to the collective gaming pieces making up a ''''domino set'''' (sometimes called a ''''deck'''' or ''''pack'''') or to the subcategory of [[tile game]]s played with domino pieces. In the area of mathematical [[tessellation|tilings]] and [[polyomino]]es, the word domino often refers to any [[rectangle]] formed from joining two congruent squares edge to edge. The traditional Sino-European domino set consists of 28 dominoes, colloquially nicknamed ''''bones'''', ''''cards'''', ''''tiles'''', ''''tickets'''', ''''stones'''', or ''''spinners''''. Each domino is a rectangular tile with a line dividing its ''''face'''' into two square ''''ends''''. Each end is marked with a number of ''''spots'''' (also called ''''[[pips]]'''') or is ''''blank''''. The backs of the dominoes in a set are indistinguishable, either blank or having some common design. A domino set is a generic gaming device, similar to [[playing cards]] or [[dice]], in that a variety of games can be played with a set.

The earliest mention of dominoes is from [[Song Dynasty]] China, found in the text ''''Former Events in Wulin''''.')

The dimension of any physical quantity is the combination of the ''''''basic physical dimensions'''''' that compose it. Some fundamental physical dimensions are [[length]], [[mass]], [[time]], and [[electric charge]]. All other physical quantities can be expressed in terms of these fundamental physical dimensions.  For example, speed has the dimension length (or distance) per unit of time, and may be measured in meters per second, miles per hour, or other units. Similarly electrical current is electrical charge per unit time (flow rate of charge) and is measured in [[coulomb]]s (a unit of electrical charge) per second, or equivalently, [[ampere]]s. Dimensional analysis is based on the fact that a physical law must be independent of the units used to measure the physical variables. A straightforward practical consequence is that any meaningful [[equation]] (and any [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] and [[inequation]]) must have the same dimensions on the left and right sides. Checking this is the basic way of performing dimensional analysis.

Dimensional analysis is routinely used to check the plausibility of [[Formal proof|derived]] equations and computations. It is also used to form reasonable hypotheses about complex physical situations that can be tested by experiment or by more developed theories of the phenomena, and to categorize types of physical quantities and units based on their relations to or dependence on other units, or their dimensions if any.

A ''''''digital system'''''' is a technology that uses discrete, discontinuous representations of information or works in a discontinuous manner. This is contrasted with continuous, or [[Analog signal|analog]] systems which behave in a continuous manner, or represent information using a [[continuous function]].

Although digital representations are [[Discrete mathematics|discrete]], the information represented can be either discrete, such as [[number]]s and [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] or continuous, such as sounds, images, and other measurements.

The word ''''digital'''' comes from the same source as the words [[wikt:digit|digit]] and ''''digitus'''' (the [[Latin]] word for ''''[[finger]]''''), as fingers are often used for discrete counting. Mathematician [[George Stibitz]] of [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] used the word ''''digital'''' in reference to the fast electric pulses emitted by a device designed to aim and fire anti-aircraft guns in 1942.')

The ''''''domino effect'''''' is a [[chain reaction]] that occurs when a small change causes a similar change nearby, which then  causes another similar change, and so on in [[linear]] sequence. The term is best known as a mechanical effect, and is used as an [[analogy]] to a falling row of [[dominoes]]. It typically refers to a linked sequence of events where the time between successive events is relatively small. It can be used literally (an observed series of actual collisions) or metaphorically (causal linkages within systems such as global finance or politics).

----

To be honest, my experience indicates that pumping ability is improved when the cold trap is in use.  However, the book I used as a reference for writing this entry, says that cold traps interfere with pumping ability.  My guess is that the additional inlet tube length required for the cold trap reduces conductance and thus pumping speed, so pumping speed may be higher without any cold trap.  However, if a cold trap is already installed, using it reduces flow of oil into the chamber, resulting in an improvement relative to not using the already installed cold trap. Admittedly, I''m not an expert, so I''d welcome input from anyone with more knowledge on the subject.

I think the trouble is that diff pumps are really bad at pumping water, which is mostly what you''re pumping when you pump from atmosphere.  Thus, employing the cold trap seems to improve pumping speed, since it pumps water very well.

--Brian Perkins

---

I have a few years of experience with a variety of pumps and traps, and I''ve found that cold traps can sometimes improve and sometimes hinder pumping efficiency. Here''s why:

1) Cold traps place baffles between the pump and chamber, and this reduces conductance to the pump. Use of undersize cold traps can also create a throat that is smaller than the pump, also reducing efficiency. Cold traps are usually not long enough for the length to have an impact. The problem is that in a high vacuum environment, gas molecules have to diffuse into the pump; they''re not pushed into it by a pressure gradient. So the molecules have to accidentally find the hole or path leading to the pump in the course of their random walk around the chamber. Smaller holes and larger baffles hinder pumping.

2) Cold traps cryopump the chamber. You wouldn''t know that from reading the wikipedia article on cryopumps, but it''s true. Vapor molecules, especially water and other outgassing products, will condense out of your chamber and onto the cold trap. In a general-purpose chamber that has not been baked out, your cold trap will typically reduce your pressure by a factor of 100, until it saturates after about 8 hours of operation. In a tighter chamber with bakeout, the cold trap willl not make as much of an improvement, (because the vacuum is already improved to begin with,) but it won''t saturate as fast.

In summary, a cold trap acts as a poor man''s cryopump in cheap systems, but act as a hairball in ultra-clean systems. Check out the [[vacuum]] page for some more discussion.

In [[vector calculus]], ''''''divergence'''''' is a [[vector operator]] that measures the magnitude of a [[vector field]]''s [[Current sources and sinks|source or sink]] at a given point, in terms of a signed scalar. More technically, the divergence represents the volume density of the outward [[flux]] of a vector field from an infinitesimal volume around a given point.

For example, consider air as it is heated or cooled. The relevant vector field for this example is the [[velocity]] of the moving air at a point.  If air is heated in a region it will expand in all directions such that the velocity field points outward from that region.  Therefore the divergence of the velocity field in that region would have a positive value, as the region is a source. If the air cools and contracts, the divergence is negative and the region is called a sink.

==Restructuring==
I have some plans for restructuring based on proper organization of drugs into their proper respective groups and subgroups.
There are three main groups of drugs which intersect and overlap -- ''''''Stimulants'''''', ''''''Depressants'''''' and ''''''Hallucinogens''''''.  (A fourth, smaller separate group would be the ''''Antipsychotics''''.)

In the ''''''Stimulant'''''' group would be a ''''Psychomotor Stimulants'''' subgroup (cocaine and amphetamines), and lesser stimulants would fall outside that group (i.e. caffeine, nicotine, etc).

In the ''''''Depressant'''''' group would be a ''''Sedative Hypnotics'''' subgroup (alcohol and barbituates paired up, and Ativan, Valium, Xanax, etc grouped up), as well as a ''''Narcotic Analgesics'''' subgroup (opium, codeine, morphine, heroin, etc).  Other depressants would fall outside these groups (GHB).

In the ''''''Hallucinogens group'''''', there would be a ''''Dissociatives'''' subgroup (ketamine, DXM, PCP, nitrous oxide, salvinorum), a ''''Deliriants'''' subgroup (muscimol, atropine, inhalants), and a ''''Psychedelics'''' subgroup (MDMA, mescaline, LSD, psilocybin, AMT, DMT, Ibogaine, etc).

Marijuana would fall just about dead center between the three main intersecting groups, since it possesses properties of each, but doesn''t really belong to any of the categories.  It is only a hallucinogen in very high doses (for some people), and many different substances can cause hallucinations in high doses.

INSERT INTO articles (title, created_at, updated_at, body) values ('Domain Name System', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '{{IPstack}}
The ''''''Domain Name System'''''' (''''''DNS'''''') is a [[hierarchical]] distributed naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the [[Internet]] or a [[private network]]. It associates various information with [[domain name]]s assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates easily memorised [[domain name]]s to the numerical [[IP address]]es needed for the purpose of locating computer services and devices worldwide. By providing a worldwide, distributed [[Index term|keyword]]-based redirection service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of the [[Internet]].

An often-used analogy to explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as the [[telephone directory|phone book]] for the Internet by translating human-friendly computer [[hostname]]s into IP addresses. For example, the domain name [[example.com|www.example.com]] translates to the addresses 192.0.43.10 ([[IPv4]]) and 2001:500:88:200::10 ([[IPv6]]). Unlike a phone book, the DNS can be quickly updated, allowing a service''s location on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue to use the same host name. Users take advantage of this when they use meaningful [[Uniform Resource Locator]]s (URLs) and [[e-mail address]]es without having to know how the computer actually locates the services.

The Domain Name System distributes the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to IP addresses by designating [[authoritative name server]]s for each domain. Authoritative name servers are assigned to be responsible for their particular domains, and in turn can assign other authoritative name servers for their sub-domains. This mechanism has made the DNS distributed and fault tolerant and has helped avoid the need for a single central register to be continually consulted and updated. Additionally, the responsibility for maintaining and updating the master record for the domains is spread among many [[domain name registrar]]s, who compete for the end-user''s (the domain-owner''s) business. Domains can be moved from registrar to registrar at any time.

The Domain Name System also specifies the technical functionality of this database service. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in DNS, as part of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]].

The Internet maintains two principal [[namespace]]s, the domain name hierarchy')

*adenosine monophosphate is the nucleotide

I''m not sure where this goes, but it should go in one of the
[[:biochemistry|biochemistry]]-related articles, and it should be borne in
mind when writing and editing these articles.

(I have trouble keeping the nomenclature straight myself, having
picked up most of my biochemistry along the way, rather than
formally.  So, this is why I''m maybe a little cranky on the
issue ;-)  --[[User:JoeAnderson|dja]]
The bases are adenine, guanine, thymine, cytosine, uracil.

The nucleosides are adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, cytidine,
and uridine.

I think I made a decent page describing [[sticky end]]s and blunt ends and I would like to connect to it from the DNA page.  I think it might be good to have a page addressing DNA manipulation techniques, but that is a rather cumbersome name for an article.  Can anybody suggest a better name?  Recombinant DNA technology?  DNA manipulation?  Thanks [[user:AdamRetchless|adam]]

In the [[DNA]] page and in the [[hydrogen bond]] page emphasis should be given to the fact that the main force responsible for the double helix stability in water is definitively NOT the hydrogen bond! This is a common misunderstanding even in the biochemistry community. Hydrogen bonds are fairly weak in a water environment becuase they readily break up forming new bonds with water molecules. Hydrogen bonds are responsible for the BASE PAIRING. The stability of the base pair and the double-helix shape are instead prevalently determined by [[hydrophobic effect]] in the stacking of the base pairs. See')

A ''''''database'''''' is an organized collection of data. The data is typically organized to model relevant aspects of reality (for example, the availability of rooms in hotels), in a way that supports processes requiring this information (for example, finding a hotel with vacancies).  

Database management systems (DBMSs) are specially designed applications that interact with the user, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose ''''''database management system (DBMS)'''''' is a [[Computer software|software]] system designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases.

In doing so, I am bound at some point to make someone mad.  If so, please post a comment on this page, which I read.  So you might understand why I say and do some of the things I say and do, a little about me:

* I believe that Wikipedia should allow people to learn and find answers to their questions quickly.  For this reason, I try to make pages smaller, where that makes sense; I myself find it easier to find my bearings among many small pages whose relationships are clear, than in one big page.

* I am not interested in flame wars.  I think that to be part of Wikipedia, it is necessary to believe that there is a large body of concepts, people, things, and events about which we agree and can say useful and interesting things.  When we step away from that realm, discussions begin to revolve around which person or group of people are right, rather than what statements are true.  I am still trying to learn to stay out of those discussions--I''m never pleased with myself when I contribute.

* I think one of the things that drives many flame wars are discussions around the definitions of words.  When discussing ideas and truths, words are only important for communication--we can use any words we want, as long as they get us both to the same idea.  When the discussion becomes about people, words and their definitions become much more important.  Words are important territory to hold in a flame war--if I can get you to define a word my way, then suddenly all the people who have ever used the word become my unwitting accomplices.  If you win the definition battle, then many quotes using that word--some of them perhaps my own!--become your ammunition against me.  I try to always remember that if my beliefs are true and useful, they will be strong even after every word has been twisted.

* For all the above reasons, I find [[talk:DavidSaff|/Talk]] pages to be often unhelpful.  If I had my way, before editing a page, I could pop over to the [[talk:DavidSaff|/Talk]] page, and find out several things:

# What edits to the page have been made or proposed, and their status: whether the edit has been made, and whether the edit is disputed.
# For disputed edits, a _summary_ of the thoughts of each side.
# Discussion, none of which is more than a week old, directed toward an eventual resolution to be included in one of the two sections above.
# Archived discussion, for points that are settled or passe.

* The point is that [[talk:DavidSaff|/Talk]] pages should strive for to the same objectives as Encyclopedia entries: concise, interesting, and meaningful content, and a neutral point of view.  In this case, the subject is not the history of England, but the history of a single Wikipedia article.

* I find that many [[talk:DavidSaff|/Talk]] pages on Wikipedia are instead long, hard-to-read collections of thoughts and criticisms, many unsigned, with an eye to the benefit of the writer, not of the reader.  Thus, I will refactor these pages where I can easily do so, and ignore them in other cases, in favor of better helping to build the true content.

Please let me know if you believe these principles are wrong, or if I have misapplied them in any given case.  I look forward to hearing your thoughts.  Thank you.')

''''''[[Dartmoor]]'''''' and the fact that a great deal of it is undisturbed for much of the year is an encouragement to the ''''''wildlife''''''. 

The more common mammals include:  Dartmoor ponies, rabbits, foxes, otters, badgers, grey squirrels, weasels, stoats, hares and deer. Rumours abound of large wild cats such as [[cougar]]s roaming wild on the moor, but little evidence has been forthcoming and until anything more substantial is available these reports should be filed under the general heading of [[cryptozoology]].

Herds of cattle and domestic sheep can be seen apparently roaming free on the moor. All are owned by farmers and let out to graze. Each is branded - the sheep with a coloured patch on its coat, unique to its owner. The livestock will naturally remain within the territory in which they are released, although walls and [[cattle grid]]s (a pit in the road covered with metal bars - impassable to hoofed animals) provide an additional level of control. 

Dartmoor has given its name to two breeds of sheep - [[Whiteface Dartmoor]] and [[Greyface Dartmoor]] - which are descended from breeds which have roamed on the moor since at least the 17th century. They are still to be found there, but are now vastly outnumbered by the [[Scottish Blackface]]. Less common species such as [[Exmoor Horn]] and [[Cheviot sheep|Cheviot]] are also to be found on Dartmoor. The most common cattle are the [[Galloway (cattle)|Galloway]] and [[Angus cattle|Aberdeen Angus]].

Reptiles include: [[Grass Snake]]s, [[Vipera berus|adder]]s, [[slow worm]]s and  [[Common Lizard]]s.

Amphibians include: [[Common frog]]; [[Common toad]] 

With its range of high grassy moorland, bogs, farmland and deep wooded valleys, Dartmoor also provides a range of habitats for a variety of birds, some quite rare. With their preferred habitat these include:
*[[Common Buzzard|Buzzard]] (trees and hedgerows)
*[[Coal tit]] (pine plantations)
*[[Great Cormorant|Cormorant]] (reservoirs)
*[[Common Crossbill|Crossbill]] (pine plantations)

{{Unreferenced|date=August 2009}}

''''''Disk Operating System'''''' (specifically) and ''''''disk operating system'''''' (generically), most often reveal themselves in abbreviated as ''''''DOS'''''', refer to an [[operating system]] software used in most computers that provides the abstraction and management of [[secondary storage]] devices and the information on them (e.g., [[file system]]s for organizing [[file (computing)|file]]s of all sorts). Such software is referred to as a ''''disk'''' operating system when the storage devices it manages are made of rotating platters, such as [[floppy disk]]s or [[hard disk]]s.

In the early days of [[microcomputer]]s, [[computer memory]] space was often limited, so the disk operating system was an extension of the operating system.  This component was only loaded if needed. Otherwise, disk access would be limited to low-level operations such as reading and writing disks at the [[disk sector|sector]]-level.

In some cases, the ''''disk operating system'''' component (or even the operating system) was known as ''''DOS''''.

Sometimes, a ''''disk operating system'''' can refer to the entire operating system if it is loaded off a disk and supports the abstraction and management of disk devices. Examples include [[DOS/360]] and [[FreeDOS]]. On the [[PC compatible]] platform, an entire family of operating systems was called ''''DOS''''.

==History==
In the early days of computers, there were no disk drives, floppies or modern flash storage devices. Early storage devices such as [[Digital delay line|delay line]]s, [[punched card]]s, [[paper tape]], [[magnetic tape]], and [[magnetic drum]]s were used instead. And in the early days of microcomputers, paper tape or [[audio cassette tape]] (see [[Kansas City standard]]) or nothing were used instead. In the latter case, program and data entry was done at [[front panel]] switches directly into memory or through a [[computer terminal]] / keyboard, sometimes controlled by a [[read-only memory]] (ROM) [[BASIC]] interpreter; when power was turned off after running the program, the information so entered vanished.

Both [[hard disk]]s and [[floppy disk]] drives require software to manage rapid access to block storage of sequential and other data.  When microcomputers rarely had expensive disk drives of any kind, the need to have software to manage such devices (the disks) carried much status.  To have one or the other was a mark of distinction and prestige, and so was having the Disk sort of an Operating System.  As prices for both disk hardware and operating system software decreased, there were many such microcomputer systems.

Mature versions of the [[Commodore 64|Commodore]], [[SWTPC]], [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari]] and [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[home computer]] systems all featured a disk operating system (actually called ''DOS''')

The ''''''''''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'''''''''' (''''''DSM'''''') published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] provides a common language and standard criteria for the [[classification of mental disorders]]. The DSM is used in the United States and to various degrees around the world. It is used or relied upon by clinicians, researchers, [[psychiatric drug]] regulation agencies, [[health insurance]] companies, [[pharmaceutical companies]], and policy makers. The current version is the DSM-IV-TR (fourth edition, text revision). The current DSM is organized into a five-part axial system. The first axis incorporates clinical disorders. The second axis covers [[personality disorders]] and [[intellectual disabilities]]. The remaining axes cover medical, psychosocial, environmental, and childhood factors functionally necessary to provide diagnostic criteria for health care assessments.

The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and [[psychiatric hospital]] statistics, and from a [[United States Army]] manual. The DSM was substantially revised in 1980. The five revisions since its first publication in 1952 incrementally added to the number of [[mental disorders]], though also removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders. The last major revision was the fourth edition (')

It is a terrible shame to waste much energy whining about disclaimers.  I would prefer a more critical approach consisting of the implications of using such a diagnostic i.e the overlap between disorders.  Also links to relevent advocates and challegeners of the DSM would be ideal.

Isn''t it like IVr or some upgrade of the original IV?

I think something needs to be said about the changes between III-R and IV, like the introduction of five different axes to differentiate mental, social and physical functioning.

''''''Digital signal processing'''''' (''''''DSP'''''') is the mathematical manipulation of an information signal to modify or improve it in some way.  It is characterized by the representation of discrete time, discrete frequency, or other discrete domain [[signal (electronics)|signal]]s by a sequence of numbers or symbols and the processing of these signals. Digital signal processing and [[analog signal processing]] are subfields of [[signal processing]]. DSP includes subfields like: [[audio signal processing|audio]] and [[speech signal processing]], sonar and radar signal processing, sensor array processing, spectral estimation, statistical signal processing, [[digital image processing]], signal processing for communications, control of systems, biomedical signal processing, seismic data processing, etc.

The goal of DSP is usually to measure, filter and/or compress continuous real-world analog signals. The first step is usually to convert the signal from an analog to a digital form, by [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] and then digitizing it using an [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC), which turns the analog signal into a stream of numbers. However, often, the required output signal is another analog output signal, which requires a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC). Even if this process is more complex than analog processing and has a [[discrete signal|discrete value range]], the application of computational power to digital signal processing allows for many advantages over analog processing in many applications, such as [[error detection|error detection and correction]] in transmission as well as [[data compression]].')

In [[mathematics]], ''''''differential topology'''''' is the field dealing with [[differentiable function]]s on [[differentiable manifold]]s. It is closely related to [[differential geometry]] and together they make up the geometric theory of differentiable manifolds.

== Description ==
Differential topology considers the properties and structures that require only a [[smooth structure]] on a manifold to be defined.  Smooth manifolds are ''softer'' than manifolds with extra geometric structures, which can act as obstructions to certain types of equivalences and [[Deformation theory|deformations]] that exist in differential topology. For instance, volume and [[Riemannian curvature]] are [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariants]] that can distinguish different geometric structures on the same smooth manifold')

DVD is an acronym and as such it needs to be identified as what it stands for in the first sentence of the encyclopedia article. I don''t care so much about the debate over whether it''s Digital Versatile Disc or Digital Video Disc, but standard practice in encyclopedias is to say what the acronym means in the first sentence of the article. For example, modifying the current opening sentence would give us,
::DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) is an optical disc storage media format that can be used for data storage, including movies with high video and sound quality.
which is a much better opening sentence.  Then in a later section in the article you can include the controversy over what it actually stands for. --[[User:Cyde|Cyde]] 21:59, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

A ''''''dolmen'''''', also known as a ''''''portal tomb'''''', ''''''portal grave'''''', or ''''quoit'''', is a type of single-chamber [[megalithic tomb]], usually consisting of three or more [[megalith|upright stones]] supporting a large flat horizontal capstone (table), although there are also more complex variants. Most date from the early [[Neolithic]] period (4000 to 3000 BC). Dolmens were usually covered with earth or smaller stones to form a [[Tumulus|barrow]], though in many cases that covering has weathered away, leaving only the stone')

==Mess==
This article is a mess...it''s too vague and squishy. Also, the separate fields don''t all belong on this page. --TheCunctator

==Edits==
C. -- looks like we were editing at the same time.  Diaspora studies is a growing field, and I wanted to make sure it got a fair shake, even though I don''t always agree with what its proponents say.  Also, I replaced the German stuff, because it really is a case where the rules for diaspora vs. bunch of refugees may apply.  I also took out the racial/nationalist stuff, because it could lead to oversimplification of motives...[[User:JHK|JHK]]

==Race==
Did you bother to look at the [[:race|race]] and [[:nationalism|nationalism]] entries? I think you''ll understand why I linked to them. It''s generally a better idea to allow people to make connections than to hide them. But it''s also better to put them into context than to simply list them, as well. 

I have to say, I''m getting annoyed at the increasing propensity of certain people to simply delete content. That means you! 

Yeah, we''re overlapping. The Wikipedia backend problems are also making this more difficult. We need that [[:ethnicity|ethnicity]] entry to be completed. It''s on my todo list.

I''d assert that there isn''t a line between diaspora studies and refugee studies; there''s an overlap. Diaspora studies refer to ethnic populations; refugee studies 
refer to refugee populations; they overlap in ethnic refugees.

I''m going to merge our entries if that''s all right, and move as much information as possible over to the [[:diaspora|diaspora]] entry as possible, so that [[:diaspora studies|diaspora studies]] will only refer to the academic field, as it should.

--TheCunctator

==Reservations==
makes sense, although I reserve the right to disagree after I see the result.  I suppose you could say that almost all victims of Diaspora could be called refugees, but not all refugees are victims of Diaspora.  By the way, I did look at the links, but think that they shouldn''t be there without a better article on the main topic.  By the way, I seldom delete huge chunks of anything, except when it''s not NPOV''d or just wrong -- or when i''m restoring a version I think is better -- i''ve restored a couple of Paul Drye versions without a pang of guilt. thx for helping get this back on an even keel, and I''m sorry to be so cranky, this has just really been disillusioning.[[User:JHK|JHK]]

==Edit, don''t delete==
You really need to stop deleting huge chunks of anything, even if (I might say ''''''especially'''''' if) it''s not NPOV''d or if there''s a better version; instead, you need to correct, contextualize, and contribute to fix what you see as wrong. If that''s too much, then state your intentions in Talk first.

That said, I''ve moved over the discussion of diasporas to the [[:diaspora|diaspora]] entry. The [[:diaspora studies|diaspora studies]] entry should be about the academic field, not about the subject of the academic field. --TheCunctator

A ''''''door'''''' is a movable structure which is used to open and close an entrance, typically consisting of an interior side that faces the inside of a structure or area and an exterior side that faces the outside region. While in some cases the exterior side of a door may match its exterior side, in other cases there are sharp contrasts between the two sides, such as in the case of the [[vehicle door]]. In addition, doors typically consist of a panel that swings on hinges or that slides or spins inside of a space.

When open, doors admit [[people]], [[animals]], [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], and [[light]]. The door is used to control the physical [[atmosphere]] within a space by enclosing the [[air draft]]s, so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled. Doors are significant in preventing the spread of [[fire]]. They act as a barrier to [[noise]]. Many doors are equipped with locking mechanisms to allow entrance to certain people and keep out others.

Doors are used to screen areas of a building for aesthetics, keeping formal and utility areas separate. Doors also have an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] role in creating an impression of what lies beyond. Doors are often [[symbol]]ically endowed with [[ritual]] purposes, and the guarding or receiving of the [[key (lock)|key]]s to a door, or being granted access to a door can have special significance.')

A ''''''director''s cut'''''' is a specially [[film editing|edited]] version of a [[film]], and less often [[television program|TV series]], [[music video]], [[Television advertisement|commercials]], [[comic book]] or [[video game]]s, that is supposed to represent the [[film director|director]]''s own approved edit. ''Cut'' explicitly refers to the process of [[film editing]]: the director''s cut is preceded by the rough [[editor''s cut]] and followed by the [[Final cut privilege|final cut]] meant for the public [[film release]].

Director''s cuts generally remain unreleased to the public because, as far as film is concerned, with most [[film studio]]s the director does not have a [[final cut privilege]]. The studio (whose investment is at risk) can insist on changes that they think will make the film more likely to succeed at the [[box office]]. This sometimes means a happier ending or less ambiguity, or excluding scenes that would earn a more audience-restricting [[Motion picture rating system|rating]], but more often means that the film is simply shortened to provide more screenings per day. The most common form of director''s cut is therefore to have [[Deleted scene|extra scenes added]], often making the')

''''''Digital video'''''' is a type of [[digital recording]] system that works by using a [[digital]] rather than an [[analog video]] signal.

The terms ''''[[camera]]'''', ''''[[video camera]]'''', and ''''[[camcorder]]'''' are used interchangeably in this article.

== History ==

Starting in the late 1970s to the early 1980s, several types of [[video production]] equipment were introduced, such as [[time base corrector]]s (TBC) and [[digital video effects]] (DVE) units (one of the former being the [[Thomson-CSF]] 9100 Digital Video Processor, an internally all-digital full-frame TBC introduced in 1980, and two of the latter being the [[Ampex]] ADO, and the [[Nippon Electric Corporation]] (NEC) DVE). They operated by taking a standard analog [[composite video]] input and digitizing it internally.  This made it easier to either correct or enhance the video signal, as in the case of a TBC, or to manipulate and add effects to the video, in the case of a DVE unit.  The digitized and processed video information from these units would then be converted back to standard analog video.

Later on in the 1970s, manufacturers of professional video broadcast equipment, such as [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] (through their [[Fernseh]] division), [[RCA]], and [[Ampex]] developed prototype digital [[videotape recorder]]s (VTR) in their [[research and development]] labs.  Bosch''s machine used a modified [[1 inch type B videotape|1')

''''''Da Capo'''''' is a [[musical term]] in [[Italian language|Italian]], meaning ''''from the beginning'''' (literally ''''from the head'''').  It is often abbreviated ''''''D.C.'''''' It is a [[composer]] or publisher''s directive to [[repetition (music)|repeat]] the previous part of music, often used to save space. In small pieces this might be the same thing as a [[Repeat sign|repeat]], but in larger works D.C. might occur after one or more repeats of small [[section (music)|sections]], indicating a return to the very beginning. The resulting [[musical form|structure]] of the piece is generally in [[ternary form]]. Sometimes the composer describes the part to be repeated, for example: ''''Menuet da capo''''. In [[opera]], where an [[aria]] of this structure is called a [[da capo aria]], the repeated section is often adorned with [[grace note]]s.

Variations of the direction are:

[[Image:French cavalry prisonners.jpg|thumb|300px|French dragoons escorting German prisoners, after the [[First Battle of the Marne]] (1914).]] The word ''''''dragoon'''''' originally meant [[mounted infantry]], who were trained in [[horse riding]] as well as infantry [[combat|fighting skills]]. However, usage altered over time and during the 18th century, dragoons evolved into conventional [[light cavalry]] units and personnel. Dragoon regiments were established in most European armies during the late 17th and early 18th centuries.

The name is possibly derived from a type of [[firearm]] (called a ''''''dragon'''''') carried by dragoons of the [[French Army]]. There is no distinction between the words [[dragon]] and dragoon in [[French language|French]]; both are referred to as ''''dragon''''.

The title has been retained in modern times by a number of [[armoured warfare|armoured]] or ceremonial mounted [[regiment]]s.

The word also means to subjugate or persecute by the imposition of troops; and by extension to compel by any violent measures or threats. The verb dates from 1689, at a time when dragoons were being used by the French monarchy to [[Edict of Fontainebleau|persecute Protestants]].')

The ''''''demiurge'''''' is a concept from the [[Platonism|Platonic]], [[Neopythagorean]], [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonic]], and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] schools of philosophy for an artisan-like figure responsible for the fashioning and maintenance of the physical universe. The term was subsequently adopted by the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]]. Although a fashioner, the demiurge is not necessarily thought of as being the same as the creator figure in the familiar [[monotheism|monotheistic]] sense, because both the demiurge itself plus the material from which the demiurge fashions the universe are considered either uncreated and eternal, or the product of some other being, depending on the system. In Gnosticism the Demiurge, creator of the material world, was not God but the Archon.')

Gorm the Old fought, was subdued by Otto I the Great, son Harald Bluetooth pledged allegiance to Otto I. He had to find rescue in Jomsburg from his son. Jomsburg was destroyed by Danes ca 1040. (Later Wollin and Pomerania). 

Danewerk, Dannewerk was started around 600 (till 1200) to ward off Slavs .Of course the heathen Danes (Vikings) also used it. It was still used in 1800. 

[[user:H.J.]]

Actually, Danewerk was me. But your date range is well out. The wall was definitely in use at the time of Charlemagne although whether or not it was complete is in dispute; it was breached during the Slavic destruction of Hedeby which was early 12th century: this kind of implies that it was on its last legs at this point. (and yes I know about the Schleswig-Holstein wars hence the reference to Austrian/Germanic destruction of a major viking strongpoint). But the real reason it was built was to keep those pesky Franks out! [[User:Sjc|sjc]]

Yep, Dahmus''s ''''Dictionary of Medieval Civilizations'''' - a low-level, but reasonably recent resource I happen to have a copy of in my office, gives 808 as the date for the wall. --MichaelTinkler

:HJ, I would like to clarify something here:  when I ask for sources, I am not looking for an Internet search.  There is no regulation on the internet as far as what people can or can''t say; there is no peer review to ensure accuracy.  You can''t trust much on the web, unless you know the source.  Also, different search engines find different things -- some require sites to register with them, for example, before they will show the site in a search.  Wikipedia is in many ways an exception from the inaccuracy rule -- but only because there are casess where many people have an interest and knowledge on a specific subject and so try to keep it clean. To me, sources are scholarly texts and articles and, more importantly, primary sources. 

:As for the encyclopedia entries on the web that you cite as evidence, I''m not sure I understand why you''ve cited them.  All they really are are descriptions of bishoprics...the fact that one is in Schleswig Holstein NOW, for example, doesn''t mean S-H existed in the 9th century...

The ''''''Dictum of Kenilworth'''''', issued 31 October 1266, was a pronouncement designed to reconcile the rebels of the [[Second Barons'' War|Barons'' War]] with the royal government of [[England]]. After the baronial victory at the [[Battle of Lewes]] in 1264, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] took control of royal government, but at the [[Battle of Evesham]] the next year Montfort was killed, and King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] restored to power. A group of rebels [[Siege of Kenilworth|held out]] in the stronghold of [[Kenilworth Castle]], however, and their resistance proved hard to crush.

A siege of the castle was started, but through papal intervention King Henry later entered on a more conciliatory path. A commission was appointed to draw up an arrangement that would be acceptable to both sides. The resulting Dictum of Kenilworth offered the rebels the right to buy back forfeited estates, at prices depending on their level of involvement in the rebellion. After initial resistance, the terms were eventually accepted. By the summer of 1267, the country was pacified, and this spirit of reconciliation would last until the 1290s. The Dictum of Kenilworth was later incorporated into the [[Statute of Marlborough]].

At the [[Battle of Lewes]] in 1264, the rebellious barons, led by [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], had defeated the royal army and taken King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] captive.')

A ''''''diesel multiple unit'''''' or ''''''DMU'''''' is a [[multiple unit]] [[train]] consisting of self-propelled carriages powered by on-board [[diesel engine]]s. A DMU requires no separate [[locomotive]], as the diesel engines are incorporated into one or more of the carriages. They may also be referred to as a [[railcar]] or [[railmotor]], depending on country.

==Design==
The diesel engine may be located above the frame in an engine bay or under the floor. Driving controls can be at both ends, on one end, or none.

==Types==
DMUs are usually classified by the method of transmitting motive power to their wheels.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Diesel-mechanical {{Anchor|DMMU}}===
In a diesel-mechanical multiple unit (DMMU) the rotating energy of the engine is transmitted via a [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] and driveshaft directly to the wheels of the train, like a [[automobile|car]]. The transmissions can be shifted manually by the driver, as in the great majority of first-generation [[British Rail]] DMUs, but in most applications gears are changed automatically.

===Diesel-hydraulic===
In a diesel-hydraulic multiple unit, a hydraulic [[torque converter]], a type of fluid coupling, acts as the transmission medium for the motive power of the diesel engine to turn the wheels. Some units feature a hybrid mix of hydraulic and mechanical transmissions, usually reverting to the latter at higher operating speeds as this decreases engine RPM and noise.

''''''Dubbing'''''', also known as ''''''re-recording'''''', is a [[post-production]] process used in [[filmmaking]] and [[video production]], in which vocal recording (like [[dialogue]]) occurs subsequent to the original recording stage. The term most commonly refers to the substitution of the voices of the actors shown on the screen by those of different performers speaking another language. However, the practice also involves the re-recording and synchronizing of audio segments with the existing footage.
In the past, the procedure was practiced in [[Musical theatre|musicals]] when the actor had an unsatisfactory singing voice, and remains in use to enable the screening of audio-visual material to a mass audience in countries where viewers do not speak the same language as the original performers.

This process whereby an actor re-records lines spoken during filming in order to improve audio quality or reflect dialogue changes is called ''''''Automated Dialogue Replacement'''''' (''''''ADR''''''), also known as ''''''Additional Dialogue Recording''''''. Music is also subject to the dubbing process in the post-editing stage of a film.

Films, videos and sometimes video games are sometimes dubbed into the local [[language]] of a foreign market. Where foreign distribution occurs, dubbing is sometimes common in theatrically released films, [[television series]], cartoons and [[anime]].

Ultra-heavy deuterium is a solid with massive weight and extreme density. Is has been artificially created in the laboratory as a potential fusion reaction fuel. I don''t have time to add it to the article but here is a non-wikipedia science article on the subject: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090511181356.htm

This merits its own section as well. 

[[User:Sean7phil|Sean7phil]] ([[User talk:Sean7phil|talk]]) 20:15, 29 November 2009 (UTC)

: But it''s not appropriate as something in this wiki. Compressed deuterium only exists for a tiny, tiny fraction of a second, while it''s under gigantic pressures from the laser. But ''''''any'''''' element can be compressed to thousands of times its normal density this way. Including ordinary hydrogen (protium). So this is not a property of deuterium per se, but of everything. SO why put it here? They''re just doing it for deuterium because they need to do it for fusion [Protium doesn''t fuse very well, even at these densities-- protium fusion in the sun only works because there''s no time limit, and even then the energy production is less than your body makes (per volume)].

The ''''''Delaware General Corporation Law'''''' (Title 8, Chapter 1 of the Delaware Code) is the [[statute]] governing [[corporate law]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Delaware]]. While most small corporations do not have a 2/3 vote requirement, in the exact opposite, most large corporations especially those incorporated in Delaware, do have a 2/3 vote requirement. A company that requires a 2/3 super-majority of shares to vote in favor of a motion can grant, in effect, veto power to a shareholder or block of shareholders that own controlling interest, which is more than 1/3 of the shares. Thus in some cases a single entity can essentially maintain controlling interest with only 33.4% of the outstanding shares. Over 50% of [[United States|U.S.]] publicly traded corporations and 60% of the [[Fortune 500]] companies are [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in that state.')

The ''''''Decca Navigator System'''''' was a [[hyperbolic navigation|hyperbolic]] [[radio navigation]] system which allowed ships and aircraft to determine their position by receiving radio signals from fixed navigational beacons. The system used [[low frequency|low frequencies]] from 70 to 129 [[kilohertz|kHz]]. It was first deployed by the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]] when the Allied forces needed a system which could be used to achieve accurate landings. After the war it was extensively developed around the [[UK]] and later used in many areas around the world.

As was the case with [[LORAN|LORAN C]], its primary use was for ship navigation in coastal waters. Fishing vessels were major post-war users, but it was also used on aircraft, including a very early (1949) application of [[moving map display]]s. The system was deployed extensively in the [[North Sea]] and was used by helicopters operating to [[oil platform]]s. After being shut down in the spring of 2000, it has been superseded by systems such as the American [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and the planned European [[GALILEO positioning system]].

Hobsons Bay Women''s Referral Service is located in Victoria, Australia, as a referral service and link to welfare agencies and legal services for victims of family violence. The new term for domestic violence is Family Violence.  This term is used in the field by workers, by law enforcement officers and the courts.  Family violence covers a range of issues and is not gender specific and is inter-generational.  It has become more common for children to abuse their parents particularly in the case of the elderly or in single parent households.  Australia is a multi-cultural society and some forms of family violence are tolerated by different cultures - this is an extremely complex situation but there is no excuse for the oppression of another using violence or bullying.

The ''''''Digital Private Network Signalling System'''''' (''''''DPNSS'''''') is a [[network protocol]] used on digital trunk lines for connecting to [[PABX]]. It supports a defined set of inter-networking facilities.

DPNSS was originally defined by [[British Telecom]]. The specification for the protocol is defined in BTNR188. The specification currently comes under the Network Interoperability Consultative Committee.

==History==
DPNSS was developed in the early 1980s by BT, or its forerunner, Post Office Telecommunications in recognition that the emerging Digital Private Circuit Primary Rate product ''Megastream'' had to address the market for both data and voice, the latter being significantly greater because of the market for PBXs. At the time, BT dictated what signalling could be used on its leased lines and, whilst it only had a minority interest in the sales of PBXs, was requested by the PBX manufacturers to produce a standard to prevent the creation of a plethora of conflicting PBX protocols being developed. Under the liberalization rules of the day (1979), BT was barred from manufacturing, selling or supplying PBXs of more than 200 extensions. Digital (PCM-based) PBXs were just starting to come into the marketplace with the Plessey PDX (a licensed version of the ROLM CBX) and the GEC SL1 (a licensed version of the Northern Telecom SL1). It was recognised that corporate customers would wish to network these systems across the country. At the time, ''CAS'' inter node signaling was slow and inter-register signaling MF5, developed from PSTN signalling protocols, was complex and would not support sufficient features.
The support for DPNSS as BT''s own signaling protocol also differentiated BT''s private circuit')

Defense in the modern world goes beyond ''Oogh'',our caveman, and his club beating down tigers. Today defense is a multibillion dollar exploration into the latest, greatest technologies. Defense today, for many Americans, means a fighter jet buzzing overhead, or raining down bombs on ''evilones'' oversees. Defense means a gun on the nightstand, a can of mace in the purse, a Club--the popular lock for steering wheels--on their car, a five-sided building with men in pressed pants, decorated with metals, standing over maps, and saving our country from those who wish us harm. Defense has become a 200-plus billion dollar budget allocation to the Armed Forces alone in the United States, not to mention Homeland Security; the FBI, the CIA, the NSC, and the thousands of police departments from New York City, New York, to Proctorville, Ohio.

Defense, though in many senses, has reamined the same; we all need to protect ourselves and those that we value--ou r family, our friends,our neighbors,the citizens of our country-- from the adversity of our enviroment, and the dangerous that surround us. Though defense may have started with Ugh fighting :off a tiger --though it likely did not--, the business of defense can no longer be seen as a solo operation:

''''''DirkJan'''''' is a comic, the creation of Dutch author and artist [[Mark Retera]]. It is also the name of its main character.

DirkJan is a loser who stumbles through life in mostly three-panel comic strips. He started out in 1989 as a student at the current [[Radboud University Nijmegen]] in the Netherlands, where he lived in a typical student house with all the stereotypical side-kicks, such as the fat boy, the beer drinker, the bossy girl who checks if everybody keeps to the house rules, and the tramps who use the heated shared hallway to stay the night. Early DirkJans contained many references to the student life of [[Nijmegen]].

DirkJan was first published in Critic, the magazine for the local union of psychology students. It then moved on to monthly publication in the student magazine of Nijmegen ([[Algemeen Nijmeegs Studentenblad]], ANS). DirkJan became known nationally when the then only commercial comics magazine of the Netherlands SjoSji (now defunct) started publishing the strip.

With the last move, the nature of the strip changed. Most of the student side-kicks got cancelled and DirkJan left university, first for jail (DJ is a notorious [[Kabouter]] abuser) and then to wander the globe and indeed space.

As of November 2007, there are thirteen DirkJan albums, tentatively named ''DirkJan 1'' through ''DirkJan 13''. Several newspapers in the [[Netherlands]] publish the comic in their daily edition.

The amateur comics magazine [[Iris magazine|Iris]] (1990 - 1995) (re)published a number of DirkJan comics, some of which were refused for publication in SjoSji.

To szopen 
The Chech and Lech is an old Polish story as is the Krok story.I do not believe, that there are any records at all of Poles, before the Polanen tribes under Mieszko I. And even the Piast rulers were only named Piasts in the 17th century. The family name was Lambert ( a good old German family name, also went to France :pronounced Lamber (silent t) . There were previous Lambert emperors. The son of emperor Arnulf of Carinthia, Bavaria was Zwentibolt (Slavic Swatopluk).And the Slavic Krol (king), derived from Karol(us) Karl, Charlemagne. It all shows that even when the Slavs moved into Germania, they also were part of the empire, that continued until 1804/6. 
Then you have to look at the original Rus history also. All the land under the Rus (before they were Russians) was called Gardarike. ( Rike ,Rix and Old Prussian Reiks or High German Reich = Rex=Regis = English kings) 

Burislaf was also a markgrave of the Saxon empire. The Royal and noble genealogy of UK lists [[:Mieszko I|Mieszko I]] as aka Burislaf von Wendland of Wendland (Wendish land in northern Germany). Mieszko I , recorded Miecislaw (or something like that) may have been a name much later given to him by Polish writers, since the only record seems to be as Dago in Dagome Iudex. Since Ote is mentioned in this, I believe that this is the record for Mieszko I and wife Oda (von Haldensleben),when by marriage to her he (Dago-bert ?) accepted the position as margrave of the empire. 

To the christianisation, all dukes, margraves etc had to accept baptism as part of receiving the position from the emperor ( see Moravians (Czechs, Slovacs) who came before the emperor in Regensburg before 900 AD). German kings/emperors never made any demarcation line between Slavic and German people or any others, such as Huns, Finns, Esthonians etc. 

Taking on the required state religion and name is typical of the Russian rulers or any others also, where Sophie von Anhalt-Zerbst , took office as Czarina Catherine II and became orthodox. When Russia conquered the North the language of Couronia, Livonia,later Latvia continued to be German until 1891. 

When you look for records, write down the current writers of the article, but also check for primary sources. This is what JHK keeps asking for. The primary source is ,when and who first recorded it. 

I have read something to the effect, that the Dagome iudex is a ''gift certificate'' , with which Dago (Mieszko I ?) gave all the land he had conquered into papal possession. He then received land back in lien. This was a standard procedure, because all land of Europe was considered as belonging to emperor and or pope, who then granted liens (loans).

The ''''''Dual Alliance'''''' was a defensive alliance between [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], which was created by treaty on October 7, 1879 as part of Bismarck''s system of alliances to prevent/limit war. In it, Germany and Austria-Hungary pledged to aid one another in case of an attack by [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. Also, each state promised benevolent neutrality to the other if one of them was attacked by another European power (generally taken to be [[French Third Republic|France]], especially after the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] of 1894).
 
When Austria-Hungary and Germany formed an alliance in 1879, it was one of the more surprising alliances of its time. Though German was spoken in each realm, sharing the same language and culture more often than not pushed Austria-Hungary and Germany apart. Additionally, the Habsburg rulers of Austria believed that the promotion of nationalism, which was favored by Germany, would destroy their empire. However, their common dislike for Russia brought the two nations together for a common cause.')

The ''''''European influence in Afghanistan'''''' refers to political, social, and mostly [[imperialism|imperialistic]] influence several [[Europe]]an nations have had on the historical development of [[Afghanistan]].

==Rise of Dost Mohammad Khan==
{{Main|Emirate of Afghanistan}}
[[File:Dost Mohammad Khan of Afghanistan with his son.jpg|thumb|left|150px|King [[Dost Mohammad Khan]] with one of his sons.]]
After the decline of the [[Durrani dynasty]] in 1823, [[Dost Mohammad Khan]] established the [[Barakzai dynasty]] after becoming the next [[List of monarchs of Afghanistan|Emir]] of Afghanistan. It was not until 1826 that the energetic Dost Mohammad Khan was able to exert sufficient control over his brothers to take over the throne in [[Kabul]], where he proclaimed himself the [[Shah]]. 

Dost Mohammad achieved prominence among his brothers through clever use of the support of his mother''s [[Qizilbash]] tribesmen and his own youthful apprenticeship under his brother, [[Fateh Khan]]. Among the many problems he faced was repelling [[Sikh Empire|Sikh]] encroachment on the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] areas east of the [[Khyber Pass]]. After working assiduously to establish control and stability in his domains around Kabul, the Shah next chose to confront the warring Sikhs.

In 1834 Dost Mohammad defeated an invasion by the former ruler, [[Shuja Shah Durrani]], but his absence from Kabul gave the Sikhs the opportunity to expand westward. [[Ranjit Singh]]''s forces occupied [[Peshawar]], moving from there into territory ruled directly by Kabul. In 1836 Dost Mohammad''s forces, under the command of his son [[Akbar Khan]], defeated the Sikhs at the [[Battle of Jamrud]], a post fifteen kilometres west of Peshawar. This was a [[pyrrhic victory]] and they failed to fully dislodge the Sikhs from Jamrud. The Afghan leader did not follow up this triumph by retaking Peshawar, however, but instead contacted [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]], the new [[British Empire|British]] governor general in [[British India]], for help in dealing with the Sikhs. With this letter, Dost Mohammad formally set the stage for British intervention in Afghanistan. At the heart of the [[The Great Game|Great Game]] lay the willingness of Britain and Russia to subdue, subvert, or subjugate the small independent states that lay between Russia and British India.

A ''''''diuretic'''''' is any substance that promotes the production of urine.  This includes [[forced diuresis]]. There are several categories of diuretics. All diuretics increase the excretion of water from bodies, although each class does so in a distinct way. Alternatively, an [[antidiuretic]] such as [[vasopressin]] is an agent or drug which reduces the excretion of water in urine.

== Medical Uses ==
In [[medicine]], diuretics are used to treat [[heart failure]], [[liver cirrhosis]], [[hypertension]] and certain [[kidney disease]]s. Some diuretics, such as [[acetazolamide]], help to make the [[urine]] more [[alkaline]] and are helpful in increasing excretion of substances such as [[aspirin]] in cases of [[drug overdose|overdose]] or poisoning. Diuretics are often abused by sufferers of [[eating disorder]]s, especially [[bulimic]]s, in attempts')

[[File:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|200px|right||The [[Lorenz attractor]] arises in the study of the Lorenz Oscillator, a dynamical system.]]

A ''''''dynamical system'''''' is a concept in mathematics where a [[Function (mathematics)|fixed rule]] describes the time dependence of a point in a [[configuration space|geometrical space]].  Examples include the [[mathematical model]]s that describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, and the number of fish each springtime in a lake.

At any given time a dynamical system has a ''''[[State (controls)|state]]'''' given by a set of [[real numbers]] (a [[vector space|vector]]) that can be represented by a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in an appropriate ''''[[state space]]'''' (a geometrical [[manifold]]).  Small changes in the state of the system create small changes in the numbers. The ''''evolution rule'''' of the dynamical system is a [[function (mathematics)|fixed rule]] that describes what future states follow from the current state.  The rule is [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]]; in other words, for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state.

==Overview==
The concept of a dynamical system has its origins in [[Newtonian mechanics]].  There, as in other natural sciences and engineering disciplines, the evolution rule of dynamical systems is given implicitly by a relation that gives the state of the system only a short time into the future.  (The relation is either a [[differential equation]], [[Recurrence relation|difference equation]] or other [[Time scale calculus|time scale]].)  To determine the state for all future times requires iterating the relation many times')

These two protruding rods are connected to a thick black metal ''band'' which surrounds the middle of the object. Above this are four diagonal slats, which tilt down outwards, topped by a dome. From the center of the dome, a third rod protrudes, with a yellow lens affixed to its end. Also attached to the dome are two lights, which project at forty-five degrees from the plane of the horizontal slats.]]

== Merge with [[naive realism]] article? ==
The merger was suggested by Srnec on 13th November 2008. It is clearly not a hot topic, however it is suggested that some kind of merger is required because it is thought that naive realism and direct realism are synonyms.

There is some overlap between the issues discussed in each article however the naive realism article is far more in-depth. For example, the Philosophy WikiProject has rated the direct realism article as Start-Class and the naive realism article as B-Class.

I would suggest that the sections from the direct realism article that are not already covered by the naive realism article should be integrated into the naive realism article and the direct realism article be redirected there. The reason for this is because the term naive realism is more commonly used than the term direct realism, especially in contemporary debates such as quantum mechanics. As a test of this here are some google results [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22naive+realism%22')

In [[mathematics]], an ''''''equivalence relation'''''' is a [[binary relation|relation]] that, loosely speaking, [[Partition of a set|partitions]] a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] so that every element of the set is a member of one and only one cell of the partition. Two elements of the set are considered equivalent (with respect to the equivalence relation) [[if and only if]] they are elements of the same cell. The intersection of any two different cells is [[empty set|empty]]; the union of all the cells equals the original set.

In [[mathematics]], given a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{mvar|X}} and an [[equivalence relation]] {{math|~}} on {{mvar|X}}, the ''''''equivalence class'''''' of an element {{mvar|n}} in {{mvar|X}} is the [[subset]] of all elements in {{mvar|X}} which are equivalent to {{mvar|n}}. Equivalence classes among elements of a structure are often used to produce a smaller structure whose elements are the classes, distilling a relationship every element of the class shares with at least one other element of another class. This is known as ''''''[[Modulo (jargon)|modding out]]'''''' by the class. The class may assume the identity of one of the original elements, as when fractions are put in [[Irreducible fraction|reduced form]].

==Notation and formal definition==
An equivalence relation is a [[binary relation]] {{math|~}} satisfying three properties:
*For every element {{mvar|a}} in {{mvar|X}}, {{math|''''a'''' ~ ''''a''''}} ([[Reflexive relation|reflexivity]]),
*For every two elements {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} in {{mvar|X}}, if {{math|''''a'''' ~ ''''b''''}}, then {{math|''''b'''' ~ ''''a''''}} ([[Symmetric relation|symmetry]])
*For every three elements {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} in {{mvar|X}}, if {{math|''''a'''' ~ ''''b''''}} and {{math|''''b'''' ~ ''''c''''}}, then {{math|''''a'''' ~ ''''c''''}} ([[Transitive relation|transitivity]]).

[[Cairo]] has been a crossroads of [[Arab]] commerce and culture for millennia, and its intellectual and [[Islam]]ic institutions are at the center of the region''s social and cultural landmark palace.

===Arab relations===

The [[Arab League]] headquarters is in [[Cairo]], and the Secretary General of the League is traditionally an Egyptian. Former [[Egyptian Foreign Minister]] [[Nabil Al-Araby]] is the present Secretary General of the Arab League. [[Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] served as Secretary General of the United Nations from 1991 to 1996.

Egypt is on good terms with [[Libya]], its western neighbor. 

Egypt has fairly good relations with [[Sudan]], its southern neighbor, although it has a land dispute with Sudan over the [[Hala''ib Triangle]], a small area of land on the Egypt-Sudan border on the [[Red Sea]] coast. Sudan claims the area. Egypt''s policy on Sudan is that it is in favor of a united Sudan. As such Egypt was not directly involved in the Sudan Peace Process that was hosted in Kenya under the auspices of [[IGAD]] and that gave the peoples of south Sudan the right to secede and form an independent state in 2001 after the long and brutal Sudanese civil war that cumulatively lasted more than 40 years and claimed over 2 million lives. In ancient times Egypt also had strong trading with Punt.They traded cloth grain copper papyrus and gems for items like myrrh,ebony,ivory,and wild animals.

===Israeli-Palestinian conflict===
Egypt is a key partner in the search for peace in the Middle East and resolution of the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]].

Egypt played an important role in the negotiations leading to the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]], which, under [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] sponsorship, brought together all parties in the region, including for the first time a Palestinian delegation, to discuss Middle East peace.

This support has continued to the present, with President [[Hosni Mubarak]] often intervening personally to promote peace negotiations. In 1996, he hosted the Sharm El-Sheikh')

''''''Politics of Eritrea'''''' takes place in a framework of a [[single-party]] [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the Eritrean [[President of Eritrea|President]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] and a single-party state, led by the [[People''s Front for Democracy and Justice]]. The popularly-elected [[National Assembly of Eritrea|National Assembly]] of 150 seats, formed in 1993 shortly after independence, elected the current president, [[Isaias Afewerki]]. There have been no general elections since its official rise to power in 1993. They are governed under the constitution of 1993. A new constitution was made in 1997, but was not implemented.

Following a [[United Nations Observer Mission to Verify the Referendum in Eritrea|successful referendum]] on independence for the Autonomous Region of Eritrea between 23 and 25 April 1993, on 19 May of that year the Provisional Government of Eritrea (PGE) issued a Proclamation regarding the reorganization of the Government. It declared that during a four-year transition period, and sooner if possible, it would draft and ratify a constitution, prepare a law on political parties, prepare a press law, and carry out elections for a constitutional government. In March 1994, the PGE created a constitutional commission charged with drafting a constitution flexible enough to meet the current needs of a population suffering from 30 years of civil war as well as those of the future, when stability and prosperity change the political landscape. 

Commission members have traveled throughout the country and to Eritrean communities abroad holding meetings to explain constitutional options to the people and to solicit their input. A new constitution was promulgated in 1997 but has not yet been implemented, and general elections have been postponed. A National Assembly, composed entirely of the PFDJ, was established as a transitional legislature; elections have been postponed indefinitely following the start of the border conflict with Ethiopia.

Independent local sources of political information on Eritrean domestic politics are scarce; in September 2001 the government closed down all of the nation''s privately owned print [[News media|media]], and outspoken critics of the government have been [[arrested]] and held without [[trial]], according to domestic and international observers, including [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]].  In 2004 the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] declared Eritrea a [[Country of Particular Concern]] (CPC) for its alleged record of religious [[persecution]]. 

At independence, the government faced formidable challenges. Beginning with a nascent judicial system, and an education system in shambles, it has attempted to build the institutions of government from scratch, with varying success.  Since then, the impact of the border war with Ethiopia, and continued army mobilisation, has contributed to the lack of a skilled workforce.  The present government includes [[legislature|legislative]], [[executive (government)|executive]], and judicial bodies.

Rehabilitation of the remainder and of the rolling stock has occurred in recent years. By 2003, the line had been restored from Massawa all the way through to Asmara.

There are no rail links with adjacent countries.

The Eritrean highway system is named according to the road classification. The three levels of classification are: primary (P), secondary (S), and tertiary (T). The lowest level road is tertiary and serves local interests. Typically they are improved earth roads which are occasionally paved. During the wet seasons these roads typically become impassable. The next higher level road is a secondary road and typically is a single-layered asphalt road that connects [[Districts of Eritrea|district]] capitals together and those to the regional capitals. Roads that are considered primary roads are those that are fully asphalted (throughout their entire length) and in general they carry traffic between all the major towns in Eritrea.

It is a moderately hard, silvery [[metal]] which readily oxidizes in air and [[water]]. Being a typical member of the [[lanthanide]] series, europium usually assumes the [[oxidation state]] +3, but the oxidation state +2 is also common: all europium compounds with oxidation state +2 are slightly [[redox|reducing]]. Europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non-toxic compared to other heavy metals. Most applications of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds.

{{infobox einsteinium}}
''''''Einsteinium'''''' is a [[synthetic element]] with the symbol ''''''Es'''''' and [[atomic number]] 99. It is the seventh [[transuranic element]], and an [[actinide]].

Einsteinium was discovered as a component of the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after [[Albert Einstein]]. Its most common [[isotope]] einsteinium-253 (half life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of californium-253 in a few dedicated high-power [[nuclear reactor]]s with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex procedure of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside of basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element [[mendelevium]] in 1955.

Einsteinium is a soft, silvery, [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[metal]]. Its chemistry is typical of the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 [[oxidation state]]; the +2 oxidation state is also accessible, especially in solids. The high radioactivity of einsteinium-253 produces a visible glow and rapidly damages its crystalline metal lattice, with released heat of about 1000 [[watt]]s per gram. Difficulty in studying its properties is due to einsteinium-253''s conversion to [[berkelium]] and then [[californium]] at a rate of about 3% per day. The isotope of einsteinium with the longest half life, einsteinium-252 (half life 471.7 days) would be more suitable for investigation of physical properties, but it has proven far more difficult to produce and is available only in minute quantities, and not in bulk.')

''''''Electrical engineering'''''' is a field of [[engineering]] that generally deals with the study and application of [[electricity]], [[electronics]], and [[electromagnetism]]. This field first became an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric [[telegraph]], the [[telephone]], and [[electric power]] distribution and use. It now covers a wide range of subfields including [[electronics]], [[digital computers]], [[power engineering]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[control systems]], [[RF engineering]], and [[signal processing]]. 

Electrical engineering may include [[electronic engineering]]. Where a distinction is made, usually outside of the United States, electrical engineering is considered to deal with the problems associated with systems such as [[electric power transmission]] and [[electrical machine]]s, whereas electronic engineering deals with the study of electronic systems including [[computers]], [[communication system]]s, [[integrated circuits]], and radar.')

{{Electromagnetism|cTopic=Electricity}}

''''''Electricity'''''' is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and flow of [[electric charge]]. Electricity gives a wide variety of well-known effects, such as [[lightning]], [[static electricity]], [[electromagnetic induction]] and the flow of [[electrical current]]. In addition, electricity permits the creation and reception of [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as [[radio waves]].

In electricity, charges produce [[electromagnetic field]]s which act on other charges. Electricity occurs due to several types of physics:
* ''''''[[electric charge]]'''''': a property of some [[subatomic particle]]s, which determines their [[electromagnetic interaction]]s. Electrically charged matter is influenced by, and produces, electromagnetic fields.
* ''''''[[electric current]]'''''': a movement or flow of electrically charged particles, typically measured in [[ampere]]s.
* ''''''[[electric field]]'''''' (see [[electrostatics]]): an especially simple type of electromagnetic field produced by an electric charge even when it is not moving (i.e., there is no [[electric current]]). The electric field produces a force on other charges in its vicinity. Moving charges additionally produce a [[magnetic field]].
* ''''''[[electric potential]]'''''': the capacity of an electric field to do [[Work (mechanics)|work]] on an [[electric charge]], typically measured in [[volt]]s.
* ''''''[[electromagnets]]'''''': electrical currents generate magnetic fields, and changing magnetic fields generate electrical currents

In [[electrical engineering]], electricity is used for:
* ''''''[[electric power]]'''''' where electric current is used to energise equipment
* ''''''[[electronics]]'''''' which deals with [[electrical circuit]]s that involve [[active component|active electrical component]]s such as [[vacuum tube]]s, [[transistor]]s, [[diode]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s, and associated passive interconnection technologies.

Electrical phenomena have been studied since antiquity, though advances in the science were not made until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Practical applications for electricity however remained few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that [[Electrical engineering|engineers]] were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society. Electricity''s extraordinary versatility as a means of providing energy means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include [[motive power|transport]], [[HVAC|heatin')

==Old discussions==
Is ''''methanophile'''' a term in current usage?  I''ve more often (only?) heard ''''methanotrope'''' used.  I''ll google it sometime to check, but would welcome some other commentary.

Also, to what extent does ''''extremophile'''' refer to single-cell organisms?  Are ''''halophytes'''', (which, if I recall correctly, are plants that tolerate salty conditions) extremophiles?  Is being tolerant of extreme conditions (for some definition of extreme) sufficient, or must an organism thrive or require extreme conditions?

There was a picture in this month''s [[:National Geographic|National Geographic]] (my in-laws buy it for me, because I tend to read it when I''m at my in-laws :-) of an algal mat growing in a volcanically active region of the Kamchatka Peninsula--I was wondering if the algae pictured qualified as an ''''extremophile''''

--[[User:JoeAnderson | dja ]]

: I agree with you about methanogens.  Many are mesophilic.  The same is true of endoliths.  I''m going to remove these two.  

: With regards to your question about single celled organisms.  The term is is not limited to unicellular life, but the vast majority of examples are single celled.  Along these lines, I added a link to antarctic krill and made the existing link to some extrempophilic insects more prominent.  [[User:Jmeppley|Jmeppley]] 01:41, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)


A lot of this page bears a strong resemblance to this:
[[http://www.micro.unsw.edu.au/rick/extremophiles.html]]
I assume the original material is public domain, or the authors are the same, or something, but I just wanted to be sure.  --[[User:Stuart Presnell]]

As far as I know methanogens are not extremophiles per se - most of them are mesophiles, they love temperatures between 20-40 degree celsius. All methanogens are archaea, indeed the term methanogen just refers to the fact that these organisms produce methane not more. -- not a wikipedia member yet

==Mesophiles are extremophiles==

According to the article mesophiles and aerobes are on the list of extremophiles, which makes people extremophiles. Am I missing something here, or do we need to put non-extremophiles in a separate list?
--[[User:ChadThomson|ChadThomson]] 10:53, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

: (I moved this topic to the en to be in line with conventions)

: Wow, how did those get in there.  Mesophile is the opposite of extremophile.  I''m taking that out as well as aerobe, anaerobic, ad anything else that refers to oxygen levels.  Extremophilism is a qualitative concept for the most part, so these are all up for debate at some level, but virtually every body of water and mud puddle in the world supports anaerobic organisms.

== Why use energy? ==
This is pretty much a ramble showing the sort of thing that might be included. I find that in conversation with smart non-physicsts, they light up when I can get the unifying reason for using the concept of energy across to them.

There might be better examples to include, a satellite launch lower bound is orders of magnitude lower than practice, maybe energy in oscillators (pendulum, LC etc) would be good.

== Matrix ==
So this article doesn''t have almost anything about exponentiation to a matrix. Maybe we should expand it a little bit and possibly include an example. It is right now merged with the section about Banach spaces, which I don''t really understand. Banach algebra seems to be a much more abstract concept. Matrix exponentiation has a lot of application in systems engineering, circuit design, biology, climate science and economy so I think it deserves an example. Anybody agree? In my opinion, the optimal thing would be to have an example of both e to a 2x2 Matrix and e to a 3x3 Matrix. Just to illustrate how much more complicated it gets with a larger matrix.

''''''Excalibur'''''' is the [[List of mythological objects#Swords|legendary sword]] of [[King Arthur]], sometimes attributed with magical powers or associated with the rightful [[sovereignty]] of [[Great Britain]]. Sometimes Excalibur and the [[Clarent|Sword in the Stone]] (the proof of Arthur''s lineage) are said to be the same weapon, but in most versions they are considered separate. The sword was associated with the [[Arthurian legend]] very early. In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], the sword is  called ''''''Caledfwlch''''''. 

==Forms and etymologies==

Since 1500, over 190 species of ''''''[[bird]]s'''''' have become ''''''[[Extinction|extinct]]'''''', and this rate of extinction seems to be increasing. The situation is exemplified by [[Hawaii]], where 30% of all known recently extinct bird [[taxa]] originally lived. Other areas, such as [[Guam]], have also been hit hard; Guam has lost over 60% of its native bird taxa in the last 30 years, many of them due to the introduced [[Brown Tree Snake]].

Currently there are approximately 10,000 species of birds, with an estimated 1,200 considered to be under threat of extinction. 

Island species in general, and flightless island species in particular are most at risk. The disproportionate number of [[Rallidae|rails]] in the list reflects the tendency of that family to lose the ability to fly when geographically isolated. Even more rails became extinct before they could be described by scientists; these taxa are listed in [[Later Quaternary Prehistoric Birds]].

The ''''''extinction dates'''''' given below are usually approximations of the actual date of extinction. In some cases, more exact dates are given as it is sometimes possible to pinpoint the date of extinction to a specific year or even day (the [[San Benedicto Rock Wren]] is possibly the most extreme example')

== Structure of page ==

I''m beginning to wonder how to structure this page. The original idea was to list the species by date of extinction, but they are often not sure. Would a geographical sorting be better?

== Structure of entries ==

Also, is it a good idea to put brief texts about the species on the listing page, or should I drop them and keep all the information on the separate bird pages? I''m beginning to lean towards the later approach. --[[User:Pinkunicorn|Pinkunicorn]]

::I''d favor the following approach: a brief statement of area of occurrence and date of extinction for every taxon, followed by an indent for subspecies. Additional explanations could go here initially (but briefly, a few lines at max - see Bay Thrush and Rodrigues Starling for taxa which demand longer explanations), but with actual species/subspecies pages becoming available, they should be merged into these ASAP (see Labrador Duck for a species where only the Location and Date info needs to be here really).

An  ''''''electromagnetic field'''''' (also ''''''EMF'''''' or ''''''EM field'''''') is a physical [[field (physics)|field]] produced by [[electric charge|electrically charged objects]]. It affects the behavior of charged objects in the vicinity of the field. The electromagnetic field extends indefinitely throughout space and describes the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]]. It is one of the four [[fundamental force]]s of nature (the others are [[gravitation]], the [[weak interaction]], and the [[strong interaction]]).

The field can be viewed as the combination of an [[electric field]] and a [[magnetic field]]. The electric field is produced by stationary charges, and the magnetic field by moving charges (currents); these two are often described as the sources of the field. The way in which charges and currents interact with the electromagnetic field is described by [[Maxwell''s equations]] and the [[Lorentz force law]].

From a [[Classical physics|classical]] perspective, the electromagnetic field can be regarded as a smooth, continuous field, propagated in a wavelike manner; whereas from the perspective of [[quantum field theory]], the field is seen as quantized, being composed of individual [[Subatomic particle|particle]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Structure of the electromagnetic field==
The electromagnetic field may be viewed in two distinct ways: a continuous structure or a discrete structure.

===Continuous structure===
Classically, electric and magnetic fields are thought of as being produced by smooth motions of charged objects. For example, oscillating charges produce electric and magnetic fields that may be viewed in a ''smooth'', continuous, wavelike fashion. In this case, energy is viewed as being transferred continuously through the electromagnetic field between any two locations. For instance, the metal atoms in a [[radio]] [[transmitter]] appear to transfer energy continuously. This view is useful to a certain extent (radiation of low frequency), but problems are found at high frequencies (see [[ultraviolet catastrophe]]).

Are you sure [[Sweden]] is a member of the European Community? It was not a member of the [[European Union]] when it was established, and the other ''new'' EU members are not on the list.

Yes, Sweden is an EU member -- every member of the EU is in the EC, and every member in the EC is in the EU. The EU and the EC are basically the same organization. (Techincally, only the EC is legally an organization, and the EU is composed of the EC and also wider non-EC responsibilities in areas such as foreign policy, security and defence, policing and crime co-operation.) Also, all the the ''new'' EU members are on the list -- your not thinking of the candidate countries are you? (They are not yet members.) --- [[User:SJK|Simon J Kissane]]

== About Candidian and the reading of the Sacra ==

In my recent rewrite of the article text concerning the First Council of Ephesus, I deleted the text about the reading of the Sacra.  My reasoning is that the discussion of the First Council of Ephesus should be succinct and get to the point quickly rather than getting into a lot of details.  The article on the [[First Council of Ephesus]] is the right place for the details.  The key points (IMO) are that the emperor sent Candidian to preside, Cyril outmaneuvered Candidian and Candidian presided over the council held by Nestorius and John of Antioch.  Ultimately, Cyril''s council was deemed to be ecumenical.  I don''t think the details about the reading of the Sacra are critical to making the point but I suppose we can mention it briefly if Montalban insists. --[[User:Pseudo-Richard|Pseudo-Richard]] ([[User talk:Pseudo-Richard|talk]]) 15:30, 9 October 2011 (UTC)

== Elfs? ==

Where did the idea that ''elf'' can be pluralised as ''elfs'' come from? I can''t find it in the Oxford English Dictionary, or Dictionary.com.--[[Special:Contributions/90.206.198.139|90.206.198.139]] ([[User talk:90.206.198.139|talk]]) 15:36, 25 December 2008 (UTC)


I wish the article would try to make clear what myths of the elves come from ordinary people, and what is made up by Snorre. For example I don''t think people distinguished between ''light'' and ''dark'' elves. 

The article could also include some etymology on the word elf (I always thought of it as having to do with river, that is, elves = river people).')

''''''Electric charge'''''' is the [[physical property]] of [[matter]] that causes it to experience a [[force]] when close to other electrically charged matter. There are two types of electric charges, called [[proton|positive]] and [[electron|negative]]. Positively charged substances are repelled from other positively charged substances, but attracted to negatively charged substances; negatively charged substances are repelled from negative and attracted to positive. An object will be negatively charged if it has an excess of [[electron]]s, and will otherwise be positively charged or uncharged. The [[Systeme International|SI]] unit of electric charge is the [[coulomb]] (C), although in electrical engineering it is also common to use the [[ampere-hour]] (Ah), and in chemistry it is common to use the [[elementary charge]] (''''e'''') as a unit. The symbol ''''Q'''' is often used to denote a charge. The study of how charged substances interact is [[classical electrodynamics]], which is accurate insofar as [[quantum mechanics|quantum effect]]s can be ignored.

The ''''electric charge'''' is a fundamental  [[Conservation law|conserved property]] of some [[subatomic particle]]s, which determines their [[electromagnetic interaction]]. Electrically charged matter is influenced by, and produces, [[electromagnetic field]]s. The interaction between a moving charge and an electromagnetic field is the source of the [[electromagnetic force]], which is one of the four [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] (See also: [[magnetic field]]).

Twentieth-century [[Oil-drop experiment|experiments]] demonstrated that electric charge is ''''[[charge quantization|quantized]]''''; that is, it comes in integer multiples of individual small units called the [[elementary charge]], ''''e'''', approximately equal to {{val|1.602|e=-19|u=[[coulomb]]s}} (except for particles called [[quark]]s, which have charges that are integer multiples of ''''e/3'''').

I''ve created a WikiProject that will hopefully help focus the efforts of all of us involved with Elvis-related articles. Obviously, those of us who work on these articles collectively know pretty much everything there is to know about Elvis. However, we must keep in mind that this is an encyclopedia and just because it''s published in a biography does not mean it should be included here. We want to present our knowledge to the reader as clearly and focused as possible, leaving out the gossip, hearsay and such. That''s what the biographies are for. So, for what is relevant in terms of an encyclopedia, we want the readers to know everything we know.

[[Image:Amplifier Circuit Small.svg|thumb|450px|A practical amplifier circuit]]
An ''''''electronic amplifier'''''', ''''''amplifier'''''', or (informally) ''''''amp'''''' is an electronic device that increases the [[Power (physics)|power]] of a [[Signal (information theory)|signal]]. It does this by taking energy from a [[power supply]] and controlling the output to match the input signal shape but with a larger [[amplitude]].  In this sense, an amplifier modulates the output of the power supply.

Numerous types of electronic amplifiers are specialized to various applications. An amplifier can refer to anything from an [[electrical circuit]] that uses a single [[active component]], to a complete system such as a packaged audio [[hi-fi]] amplifier.

== Figures of merit ==
{{Main|Amplifier figures of merit}}

Amplifier quality is characterized by a list of specifications that includes:
* ''''''[[Gain]]'''''', the ratio between the magnitude of output and input signals
* ''''''[[Bandwidth (signal processing)|Bandwidth]]'''''', the width of the useful [[#Frequency range|frequency range]]
* ''''''Efficiency'''''', the ratio between the power of the output and total power consumption
* ''''''[[Nonlinear system|Linearity]]'''''', the degree of proportionality between input and output
* ''''''[[Noise (electronics)|Noise]]'''''', a measure of undesired noise mixed into the output
* ''''''Output [[dynamic range]]'''''', the ratio of the largest and the smallest useful output levels
* ''''''[[Slew rate]]'''''', the maximum rate of change of the output
* ''''''[[Rise time]]'''''', ''''''[[settling time]]'''''', ''''''[[Ringing (signal)|ringing]]'''''' and ''''''[[Overshoot (signal)|overshoot]]'''''' that characterize the [[step response]]
* ''''''[[BIBO stability|Stability]]'''''', the ability to avoid [[Parasitic oscillation|self-oscillation]]

==Comment==
The article states:
:For example, oxygen has 6 positively charged protons, and thus in the neutral state would also have 6 (negatively charged) electrons. In dihydrogen monoxide (ie, water), each oxygen atom can be viewed as surrendering two electrons, one to each of two hydrogen atoms. The oxidation state of each oxygen atom in water then is -2, and of each hydrogen atom in water is +1.

:In the nomenclature of chemistry, the substance losing electrons is said to be the reductant and is oxidized'' by the the other substance(s) in the reaction which gain the electrons.

:The substance gaining the electrons is said to be the oxidant and is said to be reduced (by the reductant).

Now I always thought that the oxygen takes (rather than gives up) two electrons from the hydrogen atoms.  Thus the oxygen has a negative charge, and the hydrogens have a positive charge.  I believe the article is contradicting itself as it current stands.  Can someone who took chemistry more recently than me comment on this? -- [[User:The ansible|ansible]]



I think ansible is correct.  I looked this subject up in
my college chemisty text.  (')
