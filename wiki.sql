Unless someone can find a citation that Jacqueline Kennedy was inspired by the eternal flame at the arc de triomphe, we should consider this coincidence and it should be removed.

Is it right to say ''the'' tomb of the Unknown soldier, shouldn''t that be the the 
French tomb of the Unknown soldier or the tomb of the Unknown soldier in France? -Adrian.

----
I''m severely tempted to say I don''t know.

I like the idea of being more specific about which Tomb of the Unknown.  I believe in the United States the Tomb is in Arlington National Cemetary, but I don''t know if the tomb is of a soldier killed in the first world war, the second, or the civil war, or what.  I guess one soldier is enough, its the idea that counts.

Regardless, being specific that it''s the French Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, is a good revision, do it.

''''''Affirming the consequent'''''', sometimes called ''''''converse error'''''' or ''''''fallacy of the converse'''''', is a [[formal fallacy]] of inferring the [[converse (logic)|converse]] from the original statement. The corresponding argument has the general [[argument form|form]]:

#If ''''P'''', then ''''Q''''.
#''''Q''''.
#Therefore, ''''P''''.

An argument of this form is [[validity|invalid]], i.e., the conclusion can be false even when statements 1 and 2 are true.  Since ''''P'''' was never asserted as the ''''only'''' sufficient condition for ''''Q'''', other factors could account for ''''Q'''' (while ''''P'''' was false).

To put it differently, if ''''P'''' implies ''''Q'''', the ''''''only'''''' inference that can be made is ''''non-Q'''' implies ''''non-P''''.  (''''Non-P'''' and ''''non-Q'''' designate the opposite propositions to ''''P'''' and ''''Q''''.)  Symbolically:

==Significant overhaul underway==
I have made some big changes to the structure of the article, and will continue to work on text. This is a good start, but many things need to be elaborated and clarified. This entry needs serious help! I am an archaeologist with training in North America, so the emphasis may have shifted somewhat. I''m hoping others will fill in information on the discipline in other world areas. I''m also unsure how to go about making significant changes without erasing previous text. I hope no one is offended - I''m just interested in getting this entry right. --[[User:Mybvega|Mybvega]] 23:29, 20 October 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for starting this overhaul, this page really needed it. The changes are an improvement, but more work is needed.--[[User:Nathancraig|NathanCraig]] 00:43, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

''''''Amateur astronomy'''''', also called ''''''backyard astronomy'''''' and ''''''stargazing'''''', is a [[hobby]] whose participants enjoy watching the [[sky]], and the abundance of objects found in it, mainly with portable [[telescopes]] and [[binoculars]]. Even though [[scientific research]] is not their main goal, many amateur astronomers make a contribution to astronomy by monitoring variable stars, tracking asteroids and discovering transient objects, such as comets.

The typical amateur astronomer is one who does not depend on the field of astronomy as a primary source of [[income]] or support, and does not have a [[professional degree]] or advanced academic training in the subject.  Many amateurs are beginners or [[hobby]]ists, while others have a high degree of experience in astronomy and often assist and work alongside professional astronomers.

Amateur astronomy is usually associated with viewing the [[night sky]] when most celestial objects and events are visible, but sometimes amateur astronomers also operate during the day for events such as [[sunspot]]s and [[solar eclipse]]s.  Amateur astronomers often look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes, but common tools for amateur astronomy include portable [[optical telescope|telescopes]] and [[binoculars]].

People have studied the sky throughout history in an amateur framework, without any formal method of funding.  It is only within about the past century, however, that amateur astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from professional astronomy, and other related activi')

In the criminal procedure of some common law jurisdictions, an ''''''allocution'''''' or ''''''allocutus'''''' is a formal statement to the court by the defendant who has been found guilty before sentencing.

A allocution in mitigation allows the defendant to explain why the sentence should be lenient.

In [[plea bargain]]s, an allocution may be required of the defendant; the defendant explicitly admits specifically and in detail to what he or she did and for what reason, in exchange for a reduced sentence.

== Creation of the Cyrillic alphabet ==

The theory that the Cyrillic aphabet was created by St. Clement of Ohrid is old and not the most popular. Today, it is considered that the alphabet was invented in Preslav, not in Ohrid. See the article about [[Cyrillic alphabet]] for more information.[[User:Scheludko|Scheludko]] ([[User talk:Scheludko|talk]]) 18:47, 28 February 2010 (UTC)

== Lede image ==
Is there any particular reason the lede image illustrates only one alphabet, the Latin one? Given that this is a general article, maybe it would be nice to use an image (which someone could create from Inkscape or something) showing several widely-used alphabets: Latin and Cyrillic, and perhaps abudigas like Arabic and Devangari; if there''s space, we could also include slightly lesser-used alphabets and abudigas such as Hangul, Greek, and Thai (i.e., those that are used only for one major language).

''''''Astatine'''''' is a [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[chemical element]] with the [[chemical symbol]] ''''''At'''''' and atomic number 85. It occurs on Earth only as the result of the radioactive decay of certain heavier elements. All of its [[isotope]]s are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a [[half-life]] of 8.1 hours. Accordingly, much less is known about astatine than most other elements. The observed properties are consistent with it being a heavier analog of [[iodine]]; many other properties have been estimated based on this resemblance.

Elemental astatine has never been viewed, because a mass large enough to be seen (by the naked human eye) would be immediately vaporized by the heat generated by its own radioactivity. Astatine may be dark, or it may have a metallic appearance and be a semiconductor, or it may even be a metal. It is likely to have a much higher melting point than does iodine, on par with those of [[bismuth]] and polonium. Chemically, astatine behaves more or less as a [[halogen]], being expected to form ionic astatides with [[alkali metal|alkali]] or [[alkaline earth metal|alkaline earth]] metals; it is known to form covalent compounds with nonmetals, including [[interhalogen|other halogens]]. It does, however, also have a notable cationic chemistry that distinguishes it from the lighter halogens. The second longest-lived isotope of astatine, astatine-211, is the only one currently having any commercial application, being employed in medicine to diagnose and treat some diseases via its emission of [[alpha particles]] (helium-4 nuclei). Only extremely small quantities are used, however, due to its intense radioactivity.

The element was first produced by [[Dale R. Corson]], [[Kenneth Ross MacKenzie]], and [[Emilio Segr')

Likewise, a group of atoms can remain bound to each other by [[chemical bond]]s based on the same force, forming a [[molecule]]. An atom containing an equal number of protons and electrons is electrically neutral, otherwise it is positively or negatively charged and is known as an [[ion]]. An atom is [[Periodic table|classified]] according to the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus: the [[atomic number|number of protons]] determines the [[chemical element]], and the [[neutron number|number of neutrons]] determines the [[isotope]] of the element.')

Errrrrr nooooooo! I read Automated Alice and just finished it yesterday, what I''ve wrote so far are ''''my'''' ([[User:Neeklamy|Neeklamy]]''s) own words, I didn''t lift them from anywhere!

I find it a bit disconcerting to be accused of [[:plagiarism|plagiarism]] - was it not obvious that this text is just a summary? That I wrote it (in good heart) in the style of the book? The book itself came out in 1996 and has been published a number of times over since - it''s out there for anyone to track down ISBN: 0552999059 and read and it runs to a bit more than a few mere paragraphs of poorly revised text (more like 252 pages of some very witty dialogue).

I''m sure you didn''t mean offence, what with a number of indivduals stealing wholesale from various resources, but seriously, idle accusations of copyright infringement aren''t appreciated at all - personally I would never plagiarise and would never do anything to harm this new forum.

{{Neuron map|Axon}}
An ''''''axon'''''' (from Greek, axis) also known as a nerve fibre; is a long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or [[neuron]], that typically conducts [[action potential|electrical impulses]] away from the neuron''s [[cell body]]. The function of the axon is to transmit information to different neurons, muscles and glands. In certain sensory neurons ([[pseudounipolar neuron]]s), such as those for touch and warmth, the electrical impulse travels along an axon from the periphery to the cell body, and from the cell body to the spinal cord along another branch of the same axon. Axon dysfunction causes many inherited and acquired neurological disorders which can affect both the peripheral and central neurons.

An axon is one of two types of [[protoplasm]]ic protrusions that extrude from the cell body of a neuron, the other type being [[dendrite]]s.  Axons are distinguished from dendrites by several features, including shape (dendrites often taper while axons usually maintain a constant radius), length (dendrites are restricted to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer), and function (dendrites usually receive signals while axons usually transmit them).  All of these rules have exceptions, however.

Some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites.  No neuron ever has more than one axon; however in invertebrates such as insects or leeches the axon sometimes consists of several regions that function more or less independently of each other.')

I don''t have that book, and I can''t find the quoted text on the net, so I can''t verify whether or not this text was copied from that book.  I ''''can'''' verify that if it was, it is clearly a copyright violation not covered by fair use.  Small excerpts can be used in a larger work for commentary, criticism, parody, and the like; copies may also be made for classroom use.  But this doesn''t qualify as any of those: the paragraph isn''t being taken so that we can comment on itin a larger work--it''s being taken merely to reproduce it as is, for exactly the same use as the original copyrighted work, which is clearly infringement. --[[User:Lee Daniel Crocker|LDC]]
----
With apologies to the author if, e.g., the author was simply citing ANCIENT SCRIPTS as a bibliographic source, but without further information from the person who put this information up, it just looks to me like it was swiped from the book.  So I''m taking it down--though I will be very happy to put it back immediately if the author can assure me it wasn''t copied out of a book. --[[User:LMS|LMS]]

naw, that was only quoting, well, paraphrasing actually. certainly not a violation of intellectual property. Well, I 
rre-introduced some of the old info; i hope, it won''t disappear again... anyway, no quotes in it, so everybody should be happy, and no info that needs a bibliography. [[User:Wathiik|Wathiik]]

well, i think now it''s obvious that it isn''t plagiarism (reminds me of my first year of studying english when everybody warned about plagiarism... [[User:Wathiik|Wathiik]]

----
Please don''t confuse copyright violation with plagiarism--they are different things entirely.  Plagiarism is misrepresenting someone else''s work as your own; if one simply copies a paragraph from a book making no mention of the source and present it as if you had written it yourself, that''s plagiarism.  If you copy a paragraph from a book, ''''giving full credit'''' to the correct author, that''s not plagiarism, but it is probably still a copyright violation.  If you rewrite the information from a text in your own words, that''s called research :-) --LDC

I''m assuming the content of [[:agma|agma]] is no longer a copyright violation.  Another happy ending!  --[[User:LMS|LMS]]
----
Well, it never WAS  a copyright violation, even though it probably did LOOK like a violation. Anway, it''s true, a happy ending...  anyway, plagiarism is probably a form of copyright violation in its own right. You can sue someone for plagiarism, and you can sue someone for other kinds of copyright violations; although no one would sue a student, I guess... as long as s/he doesn''t publish it on the internet ...

An ''''''abscess'''''' ({{Lang-lat|abscessus}}) is a collection of [[pus]] ([[neutrophils]]) that has accumulated within a tissue because of an inflammatory process in response to either an [[infection|infectious]] process (usually caused by [[bacteria]] or [[parasite]]s) or other foreign materials (e.g., splinters, [[bullet]] [[wound]]s, or injecting needles). It is a [[immune system|defensive reaction]] of the tissue to prevent the spread of infectious materials to other parts of the body. 

The organisms or foreign materials kill the local [[cell (biology)|cells]], resulting in the release of [[cytokine]]s.  The cytokines trigger an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]], which draws large numbers of [[white blood cell]]s to the area and increases the regional [[blood]] flow.

The final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall, or capsule, that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep the pus from infecting neighboring structures. However, such encapsulation tends to prevent immune cells from attacking bacteria in the pus, or from reaching the causative organism or foreign object.

Abscesses must be differentiated from [[empyema]]s, which are accumulations of pus in a preexisting rather than a newly formed anatomical cavity.

== Online algorithm in testing yields horrible results when mean=~0 ==

Most all the tests I''ve seen of these algorithms add some unrealistic constant (i.e. 10^6 or larger) to the dataset to demonstrate that the suggested algorithm on this page is indeed better. I naively used this algorithm in my own work, to horrible effect. My dataset consists of a large number of discrete values, perhaps with the values -1, 0, or 1, and with an average usually between -1 and 1. I wrote the following simple test program to demonstrate the difference in results between what I''ll call METHOD1 (using a running sum and sum of squares of the dataset) and METHOD2 (using a running computation of the average and the variance, which the current wiki strongly recommends).

A [[List of Prime Ministers of Antigua and Barbuda|Prime Minister]] is appointed by the Governor-General as the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]; the Prime Minister advises the Governor-General on the appointment of a Council of Ministers. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government.  [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the two chambers of the [[Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda|Parliament]]. The [[bicameral]] Parliament consists of the Senate (seventeen-member body appointed by the Governor General) and the House of Representatives (seventeen seats; members are elected by proportional representation to serve five-year terms).

Antigua and Barbuda has a long history of free elections, three of which have resulted in peaceful changes of government. Since the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 1951|1951 general election]], the party system has been dominated by the personalist [[Antigua Labour Party]] (ALP), dominated by the Bird family, particularly Prime Ministers [[Vere Bird|Vere]] and [[Lester Bird]]. The opposition claimed to be disadvantaged by the ALP''s longstanding monopoly on patronage and its control of the media, especially in the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 1999|1999 general election]]. The [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 2009|most recent elections]] to the House of Representatives were held on 12 March 2009. The [[United Progressive Party (Antigua and Barbuda)|United Progressive Party]] government was re-elected with nine seats and supported by the sole member from Barbuda, affiliated to the [[Barbuda People''s Movement]]. The Antigua Labour Party has seven seats in the House of Representatives.

Constitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association. Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the eastern Caribbean court system. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.
Jurisprudence is based on English [[common law]].

==Executive branch==
As head of state, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] is represented in [[Antigua and Barbuda]] by a governor general who acts on the advice of the prime minister and the cabinet.

The ''''''economy of American Samoa'''''' is a traditional [[Polynesia]]n economy in which more than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic activity is strongly linked to the [[United States]], with which American Samoa conducts the great bulk of its [[foreign trade]]. [[Tuna]] [[Commercial fishing|fishing]] and [[Fish processing|processing]] plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna being the primary export. Transfers from the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] add substantially to American Samoa''s economic well-being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa''s remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. [[Tourism]], a developing sector, may be held back by the current financial difficulties in [[East Asia]].

The word ''''''''''abbot'''''''''', meaning father, is a [[title]] given to the head of a [[monastery]] in various traditions, including [[Christianity]].  This article is intended to present facts related to the role and history associated with abbots in Christianity.  The [[office]] may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not actually the head of a monastery. The female equivalent is [[abbess]].

==Origins==
The title had its origin in the [[monastery|monasteries]] of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]], spread through the eastern [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]], and soon became accepted generally in all languages as the designation of the head of a monastery. The word is derived from the [[Aramaic]] ''''''ab'''''' meaning ''''father'''' or ''''''aba'''''', meaning ''''my father''''.

Throughout history, forms of [[art]] have gone through periodic abrupt changes called ''''''artistic revolutions''''''.  Movements have come to an end to be replaced by a new movement markedly different in striking ways.  See also [[cultural movement]]s.

== Artistic revolution and cultural/political revolutions ==

The role of [[fine art]] has been to simultaneously express values of the current culture while also offering criticism, balance, or alternatives to any such values that are proving no longer useful. So as times change, art changes. If changes were abrupt they were deemed revolutions. The best artists have predated society''s changes due not to any prescIence, but because sensitive perceptivity is part of their ''talent'' of seeing.

Artists have had to ''see'' issues clearly in order to satisfy their current clients, yet not offend potential patrons. For example, paintings glorified aristocracy in the early 17th century when leadership was needed to nationalize small political groupings, but later as leadership became oppressive, satirization increased and subjects were less concerned with leaders and more with more common plights of mankind.

In its origins and its first golden age, no art owes quite as much to state power as French painting does. It was in the age of absolute monarchy launched by Louix XIV in the 17th century that the likes of Poussin and Le Brun put France in the forefront of European art.

In which aspects was Java influenced by Ada, and Ada 2005 influenced by Java? --[[User:Abdull|Abdull]] ([[User talk:Abdull|talk]]) 23:27, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

::That can''t be true. The interfaces are from Ada 83, and at that time Java wasn''t even conceived in a mystical hallucination. Of course Java borrowed it from Ada 83!

== Was the analytical engine ever built? ==

The history of computers page says that the analytical engine was never built, this page at least implies that it was. Which is correct? .charles Babbage

:It was never built. His son built a part of it (arithmetical unit and printer) which  the most important control unit which would make it programmable. I''ll clarify that. --AxelBoldt

:As far as I understand, his son build a 4-function calculator with printer by his own design (derived from Babbage''s mill). And Babbage did build part of the mill including the printer, but this is a different machine. The latter can be recognized as having many horizontal racks in it and several cam wheels in front of it.[[User:Svenpb|SvenPB]] 14:43, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

This page states that the analytical engine was a hundred years ahead of comperable...computers. Were there other computer at the time of the analytical engine? Or was it the technological equivalent of computers that would be built a century later?   --rmhermen

:There were no other computers at the time. The first comparable ones appeared 100 years later. --AxelBoldt

:The key to Babbage''s idea was to seperate calculation and memory. This was only reinvented a century later. In Babbage''s time non-programmable calculators were build. Schickard''s and Leibniz'' machines could multiply. Schickard used the principle of Napier''s bones. Leibniz used the principle of the stepped drum. And Schultz actually build a difference machine in Babbage''s time. Babbage and Schultz have also met. Schultz'' machine looks ok, but as I understand it was not very well thought out and didn''t work very well (for example the position of the wheels wasn''t defined. Babbage''s used springs for that. In general Babbage''s machines are not matched by any other design from a mechanical point of view).[[User:Svenpb|SvenPB]] 14:38, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

This article will go through a wide range of topics of the ''''''geography of the state of [[Alabama]]''''''. It is 30th in size and borders four [[U.S. state]]s: Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida. It also borders the Gulf of Mexico.

==Physical features==
{{see also|Geology of Alabama}}
Extending entirely across the state of Alabama for about {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} northern boundary, and in the middle stretching {{convert|60|mi|km|0}} farther south, is the [[Cumberland Plateau]], or [[Tennessee Valley]] region, broken into broad tablelands by the dissection of rivers. In the northern part of this plateau, west of [[Jackson County, Alabama|Jackson county]], there are about {{convert|1000|sqmi|km2}} of level highlands from {{convert|700|to|800|ft|m|-1}} above sea level. South of these highlands, occupying a narrow strip on each side of the [[Tennessee River]], is a country of gentle rolling lowlands varying in elevation from {{convert|500|to|800|ft|m|-1}}.  To the northeast of these highlands and lowlands is a rugged section with steep mountain-sides, deep narrow coves and valleys, and flat mountain-tops.  Its elevations range from {{convert|400|to|1800|ft|m|-1}}.  In the remainder of this region, the southern portion, the most prominent feature is ''''Little Mountain'''', extending about {{convert|80|mi|km|0}} from east to west between two valleys, and rising precipitously on the north side {{convert|500|ft|m|-1}} above them or {{convert|1000|ft|m}} above the sea.

Adjoining the Cumberland Plateau region on the southeast is the [[Ridge-and-valley Appalachians|Appalachian Valley]] (locally known as Coosa Valley) region, which is the southern extremity of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], and occupies an area within the state of about {{convert|8000|sqmi|km2|-3}}.  This is a [[limestone]] belt with parallel hard rock ridges left standing by erosion to form mountains.  Although the general direction of the mountains, ridges, and valleys is northeast and southwest, irregularity is one of the most prominent characteristics.  In the northeast are several flat-topped mountains, of which Raccoon and [[Lookout Mountain|Lookout]] are the most prominent, having a maximum elevation near the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] line of little more than {{convert|1800|ft|m|-1}} and gradually decreasing in height toward the southwest, where [[Sand Mountain (Alabama)|Sand Mountain]] is a continuation of Raccoon.  South of these the mountains are marked by steep northwest sides, sharp crests and gently sloping southeast sides.

Southeast of the Appalachian Valley region, the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Plateau]] also crosses the Alabama border from the N.E. and occupies a small triangular-shaped section of which [[Randolph County, Alabama|Randolph]] and [[Clay County, Alabama|Clay]] counties, together with the northern part of [[Tallapoosa County, Alabama|Tallapoosa]] and [[Chambers County, Alabama|Chambers]], form the principal portion.  Its surface is gently undulating and has an elevation of about {{convert|1000|ft|m|-2}} above sea level.  The Piedmont Plateau is a lowland worn down by erosion on hard crystalline rocks, then uplifted to form a plateau.

The remainder of the state is occupied by the ''''Coastal Plain''''.  This is crossed by foot-hills and rolling prairies in the central part of the state, where it has a mean elevation of about {{convert|600|ft|m|-1}}, becomes lower and more level toward the southwest, and in the extreme south is flat and but slightly elevated above the sea.
The Cumberland Plateau region is drained to the west-northwest by the [[Tennessee River]] and its tributaries; all other parts of the state are drained to the southwest. In the Appalachian Valley region the [[Coosa River]] is the principal river; and in the Piedmont Plateau, the [[Tallapoosa River]].  In the Coastal Plain are the [[Tombigbee River]] in the west, the [[Alabama River]] (formed by the Coosa and Tallapoos')

[[File:Motorola 6800 Assembly Language.png|thumb|Motorola MC6800 Assembly Language]]
An ''''''assembly language'''''' is a [[low-level programming language]] for a [[computer]], or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong (generally [[one-to-one correspondence|one-to-one]]) correspondence between the language and the [[computer architecture|architecture''s]] [[machine code]] [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]].  Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture, in contrast to most [[high-level programming language]]s, which are generally [[porting|portable]] across multiple systems.

Assembly language is converted into executable machine code by a [[utility program]] referred to as an ''''[[#Assembler|assembler]]''''; the conversion process is referred to as ''''assembly'''', or ''''assembling'''' the code. 

Assembly language uses a [[mnemonic]] to represent each low-level machine operation or [[opcode]].  Some opcodes require one or more [[operand#Computer science|operands]] as part of the instruction, and most assemblers can take labels and symbols as operands to represent addresses and constants, instead of [[hard coding]] them into the program.  ''''''Macro assemblers'''''' include a [[macro (computer science)|macroinstruction]] facility so that assembly language text can be pre-assigned to a name, and that name can be used to insert the text into other code. Many assemblers offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program development, to control the assembly process, and to aid [[debugging]].

The ''''''alphorn'''''' or ''''''alpenhorn'''''' or ''''''alpine horn'''''' is a [[Brass instrument|labrophone]], consisting of a wooden [[natural horn]] of [[bore (wind instruments)|conical bore]], having a wooden cup-shaped [[mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]], used by mountain dwellers in [[Swiss Alps|Switzerland]] and elsewhere. Similar wooden horns were used for [[communication]] in most mountainous regions of [[Europe]], from the [[French Alps]] to the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]].

For a long time, scholars believed that the alphorn had been derived from the Roman-Etruscan [[lituus]], because of their resemblance in shape, and because of the word ''''liti'''', meaning Alphorn in the dialect of [[Obwalden]]. There is no documented evidence for this theory, however, and, the word ''''liti'''' was probably borrowed from 16th-18th century writings in Latin, where the word ''''lituus'''' could describe various wind instruments, such as the [[natural horn|horn]], the [[crumhorn]], or the [[cornett]]. Swiss naturalist [[Conrad Gesner]] used the words ''''lituum alpinum'''' for the first known detailed description of the alphorn in his ''''De raris et admirandis herbis'''' in 1555. The oldest known document using the German word ''''Alphorn'''' is a page from a 1527 account book from the former [[Cistercian]] abbey St. Urban near [[Pfaffnau]] mentioning the payment of two [[Batzen]] for an itinerant alphorn player from the [[Valais]].

17th-19th century collections of alpine myths and legends suggest that alphorn-like instruments had frequently been used as signal instruments in village communities since medieval times or earlier, sometimes substituting for the lack of [[church bells]]. Surviving artifacts, dating back to as far as ca. AD 1400, include wooden [[Brass instrument|labrophones]] in their stretched form, like the alphorn, or coiled versions, such as the ''')
